I really enjoyed eating these jellied treats, which were dusted with granulated sugar,  as they definitely satisfied a sweet tooth. I still enjoy them on occasion, though they are not as easy to find as in the old days, having waned somewhat in popularity. My particular favorite was the cherry flavor. If they had sold an all cherry pack, I would have bought them by the ton. Luckily for me, an all cherry pack was not available.  I also enjoyed the licorice and orange flavors. Lemon and lime, however,  were the flavors that I liked least, so I would benevolently offer them to my younger sisters. I was all heart in those days."

There's a reason why canned Pumpkin Pie filling is so popular and now you can have the same convenience with this brand of canned Sweet Potato pie filling. The canned filling also uses just the heart of the sweet potato, what most people call ""Yams"" so you get a better overall resultthat is smoother and sweeter than if you go about making a pie the old-fashioned way.  An added benefit is less mess and ease of clean-up.<br /><br />Unless you live in an area where Southern Cooking ingredients are easily available at the supermarket, you most likely will not find this product on the grocery store shelves.  Ordering it in quantity is not a bad idea since it stores well and when you do finally make it, more than one is usually in order.  It's also good to have on hand for unexpected company and to make as get-well gifts or to bring for Potlucks.  Once you try it, you'll most likely never make a pumpkin pie again!<br /><br />A Pantry essential!"

My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite."

I usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out, other cats must love it too.  The cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty.  It's just a very nice variety and something I'm sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.

A good cup of coffee starts with (surprise) excellent coffee beans. This may seem a truism but it is impossible to substitute ""coffee crystals"" (how natural) or beans that are not Arabica and obtain a satisfactory brew.<br /><br />Secondly is the roasting of which Gevalia excels and finally, for flavored brands, the subtlety of the infusion of flavors.  In this case there is no comparison with the many rivals - it is the best - deep, throaty, refreshing aftertaste, a superb offering."

He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it."

It's pricey and the cans are very small, but if you want to spoil your cat for his birthday, holidays, etc., then they're great for that. My cat doesn't really care for most of them - he prefers the chicken hearts and livers the most, but could care less if he has it or not. I buy these occasionally, but it really isn't worth it too much for me to do so because he just doesn't care that much about the taste. It doesn't drive him to his dish and actually, he leaves a lot of it there and just wants his regular old Friskies. I have a Persian too, just like the commercial, but mine doesn't really like it!"

It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one."

In case you are not familiar with it, I must say that you are really losing something great...<p>Dulce de leche is a dessert that can be eaten alone or as a topping (for example, on waffles, bread or ice cream). It is also used a lot in cakes and other pastries, and its savor is sweet. It is made by blending hot milk, sugar, and vanilla, and as a result has some nutritional value. However, the most important thing is that it is mouthwateringly delicious :)<p>Even if this product is extraordinarily good, it is important to choose the right label, because a good one can be guarantee of excellence. In my opinion, &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is one of the few labels that allow you to be certain that what you are going to eat is not only tasty, but also made of  superior quality raw ingredients. &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is very well-known in Argentina, but has also won some prizes in USA. For example, this product won the 2000 Fancy Food Show's Gold Trophy for spreads/sweet toppings. <p>All in all, I advise you to indulge yourself and give &quot;La Salamandra&quot;'s dulce de leche a try. The price isn't overly high, so you don't have much to lose, and all to win :)<p>Belen Alcat"

It was a pleasant surprise.  Once the box was done, I found myself really missing it, and am glad to have found a source on the Web, since flying to Seattle to buy it would be a bit over the top.  I prefer it to other good English/Irish Breafast teas, and it's got Lipton's &amp; Red Rose (what's available locally) beat by a mile.  You don't have to drink it with milk, either.  It's a really enjoyable tea."

I nearly burned my tounge off but it tasted sooooo good. So after the initial pain, you'll love it. It is perfect for the people who are bored with regular hot sauces. Nothin compares to this fabulous hot sauce. I put it on everything. It'll add spice and flavor to any dish or put it directly on food. I'm not sure that it is reccomended to put it directly on food, but I do it and love it. If you think you've tried every hot sauce and think you can handle the heat, then you should try Dave's to proove yourself wrong! I love Dave's Insanity Sauce!!!!"

Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead."

I'm a runner for the University of Pittsburgh, and it's the one thing I never forget to bring to meets. Don't get too much of it if you're prone to gaining weight, however. While it's really good, it has 11 grams of fat per every 27 grams of nutella, making it over a third pure fat. If you're already fat, and you know that those Subway walks aren't going to make you into the next Jared, however, get some of this stuff. It's like Ben and Jerry's, only spreadable."

As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food.  My dogs poop doesnt really stink!  True!  Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!

The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon, peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor.  They cook easily in either the conventional oven, or on the grill when wrapped in foil!  Go ahead, treat yourself!"

Even non-vegetarians will find this dish very tasty, hearty and satisfying.  Can also be used as a great filling for tacos or enchiladas!!  You won't be sorry."
04	52233,B000M7NH8I,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,8/3/04,5,5,5,Put a cold on hold with this amazing tea!,"I bought this tea mainly to have something soothing to drink when I'm not feeling well. However, on several different occasions, I made some for my husband just as he was starting to show signs of getting sick, and he is convinced that the tea prevented him from getting a full-blown cold. Now he SWEARS by the stuff and asks me to make him some of that &quot;tea with china in it&quot; (for e-CHINA-cea) whenever he starts to get symptoms.<br /><br /> The tea has a pleasant herbal taste that is perfectly enhanced with a little honey but fine without as well. As an added bonus, the box describes simple yoga stretches to provide relaxation and stress relief, and the tag of each tea bag offers a brief meditation. Highly recommended!"

First came up on it in a Greek fast food place near 9th and Congress just south of the Capital. Then, found it in Central Market. Was a two bottle-a-day man by the time I had to get out of Austin. A must try if you like a just right natural orange flavor soda."

It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one."
04	84327,B0002IMRQA,A2LAHAIVTKWIJ1,10/4/04,4,4,5,Big Red - Absolutely the Best!!,"Big Red - the unofficial soda of Texas is excellent.  It's hard to pinpoint the exact taste; some say bubble gum, while others compare it to cherry.  Regardless, you should definitely give this a try.  Best tasted cold - you won't regret.  I only wish it was distributed in New England."

The flowers arrived carefully packed and beautifully wrapped in an ingenious, sturdy flower box which included a free packet of flower food, a cold-pack to keep the flowers fresh during shipping and instructions on how to maintain them so they stay beautiful for a week or more.  The flowers were big, bright and smelled great.  Definitely reccommend this for anyone looking to make a special impression."

Very quick and easy to do, just need a blender, ice and milk. It is amazing! A rich wonderful chocolate flavor! I told my husband I am going to need a constant supply of this stuff, I am addicted already! Definately a treat worth buying!"
04	40043,B0000DG4MO,A13PD81EKUMR7A,6/7/04,0,0,5,"This is very hot, not for the tobasco lovers...","If you get this sauce for the first time, I would take a edge of a toothpick and dip it in the sauce, and get the smallest amount on your tounge. It will burn for a good 10 minutes. This will let you know exactly how hot this sauce is. While I would bet most people use this sauce as an additive in other foods like salsa or chili, I like to put it on burittos (the football sized ones from mexican resturants), about one drop every third bite. But if you eat it that way, be prepared to pay the price. Your mouth will burn with no relief in sight. Your sinuses will clear and your nose will run uncontrollably. Your eyes may turn red, and you might have a hard time breathing. And don't forget about that second burn, the next time you use the toilet (that is a serious warning. I was at a mexican resturant with a friend who ate dave's on his burrito. Dave's kicked in and he had to go. Everyone in the resturant could hear him howling in pain while he was in the bathroom). I only know of one other person who can eat the sauce as a sauce. Everyone else who has tried it has begged for an ambulance or help. It is that hot. And I love it.<p>One other note. If you use it as an additive, a little will crank up the heat level of most foods. If you don't think the hot salsa from the grocery store is hot, a few drops of this will make that salsa much hotter. But do yourself a favor, and make your own salsa. It is easy. I chop up two jalepenjo peppers, a onions, a can of diced tomatoes, maybe subsitute a chipolte if i want more sweetness, the juice of a lime, and a dash of dave's. Salt it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. After an hour, drain the liquid into the blender, and add in one more can of canned tomatoes. Blend it, and then add it back to the salsa mixing it up. For something different, chop up a bit of mint for the salsa. It will give an odd taste. Your mouth will burn as you breath out, and cool as you breath in."

You know darn well that they were one of your favorites as a kid, and you can't resist a package (or two) even today.  I love the Cherry flavored, and wish that they would introduce a Red-only package of Chuckles (if only for a limited edition, and boy would I hold on to a few of those for posterity).  A tip for you Chuckles-lovers-- freeze 'em!  They last a lot longer that way and are well complimented by your favorite non-caloric beverage (we ladies need to watch our expanding figures, unless the stork is on the way).  God Bless Chuckles."

04	48697,B0001CXRLQ,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,12/4/04,29,36,5,Magic Potion from South America.,"Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word ""mati"" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts."

Everything about this product--packaging, texture, and taste--tells you that it was lovlngly produced under rigid standards. Moreover,if you've tried a lot of ""kona"" coffees like I have, you know how widely the taste and quality can vary.

But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure."

It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.  My cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more.  They should send me discounts for as much of this stuff I buy.  I buy it by the case if that gives you some idea!

(unless you like that sort of thing, which we don't so it's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).<br /><br />Anyways- - these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10."

My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner."
