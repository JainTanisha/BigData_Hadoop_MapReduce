A few squirts of lime juice into water makes a wonderful and healthy alternative to carbonated beverages (and without sugar!). <p>Additionally, they're essential for doing salsa right.  <p>1/4 C Lime juice (from 4 limes)<br />10 small tomatillos, husks removed and washed (ASIN B0000TL6DG)<br />2-3 Chipotles, seeds removed (ASIN B0000EIDSR)<br />1 C cilantro, roughly chopped<br />8 small Tomatoes<br />1 small onion (optional)<br />Salt to taste<p>Cook tomatillos, tomatoes and onion: place on cookie sheet and broil at 500 degrees. The tomatoes will come out in about 10 minutes, the tomatillos and onion 15-20 minutes. Let cool, then puree the tomatillos in a blender with the lime juice, boullion garlic and the chipotles. Add half the cilantro, and whirl just a little bit. Add remaining ingredients. Let stand for about 30 minutes then serve at room temperature."

Often described as having a burnt taste, Starbucks beans are known for their strongly roasted taste.  Maxwell House afficionados should steer clear.<p>Before you invest in Starbucks coffee, make sure you like the flavor by tasting the brew at a local franchise.  If you don't have one near you, make sure you like a strong coffee flavor.  Although I enjoy Starbucks coffee myself, I am leery of recommending it to the uninitiated.  If you like the taste, stock up now.  The coffee stores well for months in the freezer."

How would chatchi get through the work day without his Chuckles -- the delicious, fat-free candy that provides you with the sweet-filled enjoyment you earn every day.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon carries this delicious, chewy, fruity candy, and chatchi can get back to doing his job.<br /><br />chatchi's only complaint about Chuckles is the black licorice flavor.  chatchi normally likes black licorice, but this flavor is so overpowering, chatchi needs to eat it last, so as not to ruin the remaining cherry, orange, lemon and lime flavors.<br /><br />chatchi loves Chuckles."

I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare."
03	42227,B0000A0BS8,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,10/31/03,5,5,4,I gave up on other coffees,"The grocery store has all kinds of &quot;gourmet&quot; coffees laid out. Each one I tried tasted like dust. Maybe they are ubiquitous, but Starbucks puts out a decent product and I can get a good cup in the a.m. and that's important.<p>The Breakfast Blend is a bit mild for my tastes (I like really STRONG coffee) but for guest and general consumption, this is a mild, aromatic coffee that is better than most."
03	26313,B000121BY6,A281NPSIMI1C2R,12/10/03,9,9,5,I fell in love in Paris,"Yes, with this juice. Apparently I'm not the only person who loves this drink, it is the leading orange carbonated soft drink in France. What I love most about this drink is the not-too-sweet flavor of the carbonated juice. This is not like the super sweet orange drinks that are normally carbonated. It is more like carbonated water with a splash of real orange juice and flavor.<br /><br />I think I first tasted this juice in a caf&eacute; next to the Moulin Rouge in Paris. At least, that is what I remember when we ate lunch after stepping off the tour bus. Anyway, imagine my surprise when I found it was also being sold over here in local tea shops and grocery stores. And now it is here at our very own Amazon!<br /><br />A deliciously light taste and not overly sweet. Perfect for picnics and parties.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
03	67497,B0000D9N7U,AQFIH82DRPMW,11/15/03,26,26,5,Try It!,"If you've never had real Swiss fondue, you're really missing something special.  My only regret is that I live in an area that usually doesn't get cold enough to really enjoy fondue to its fullest.  To compensate (and because we love winter), my wife and I often go to the mountains where it does snow and when we do, one of the first things we enjoy is Swiss fondue.<p>I've found that the cheeses in this assortment make a wonderful and very authentic Swiss fondue.  Just be sure to have a loaf of crusty French bread handy as well as white wine and kirsch.  And don't skimp on the kirsch; it really makes the fondue special.<p>My family and I have found that fondue is best served the traditional Swiss way...as a main course.  It's just too filling for an appetizer and just so good you want to eat your fill!  There's nothing quite as relaxing as a good fondue on a cold winter's night.  This cheese assortment is the first really authentic fondue assortment I've found since my days of backpacking and hitchhiking around Europe.<p>I really can't praise this cheese assortment highly enough.  You really have to make a fondue yourself and taste how good it is to believe it.  Try it!  Please!  Once you do, you'll become an addict!"

My favorite is definitely tangerine - but it's always a treat to try new and different flavors.  This box comes with a guide that tells you which flavors are which, so you can avoid the ones you dislike (for me - peanut butter jelly beans.. gag!).  It's pretty good size with a decent amount of jelly beans for the price - Jelly Bellies have never been cheap!  It's well worth the cost though, and a GREAT gift this year for Christmas!"
03	43130,B0000W2SZS,A2BETN6Y2DEFZ1,11/21/03,11,11,5,"Imparts wonderful, light flavor to dishes","I discovered these oils years ago, bought one of each flavor, and was thunderstruck at the quality. I use these in place of vegetable or olive oil whenever a dish calls for a similar flavor ingredient (to give it the extra flavor &quot;kick&quot;), but I found myself using them sparingly since I didn't know where to find more when they're gone! I'm almost out of the bottles I bought (just opened 2 of them, and they're fresh as ever!) and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon! The Lemon oil makes a wonderful Greek Saganaki (flamed Feta or Kaseri cheese), the Lime oil is fantastic for Thai cooking and it's many lime-based dishes, and the Orange oil I use in Salmon marinades, as well as with Oriental stir-fry &amp; Chinese duck--I may even try it in making Duck a L'Orange! I don't recall what I paid when I initially purchased them, but as gourmet oils are pricey to begin with, I would consider this a reasonable price, especially considering Amazon's free shipping &amp; the convenience of to-your-door delivery! The bottles are also attractive to display, &amp; are so tall &amp; slim that they take up very little space on your counter. Treat yourself to these oils!"

03	30628,B00008RCMI,A3AKWA5CWSKOOH,11/5/03,0,0,4,Refreshing Mouth Freshner!,"A tennis player hubby of mine got this pack on the rack of his opel corsa and casually,I started cherishing the peppermint flavour. It's gotta lasting refreshing flavour but the best part is, its real mouth freshner and above all, keeps my teeth so whiter and feels good chewing for a long time. Normally, Indians prefer 'mukhwas-masalas' after lunch or dinner but I prefer the chewing gum as it refreshes the taste buds. Good pick."
