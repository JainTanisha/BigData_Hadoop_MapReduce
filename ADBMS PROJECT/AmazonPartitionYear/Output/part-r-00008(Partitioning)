Echinacea is a Native American herb and is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines in the US and Europe.  This tea delivers the immune boosting properties of organic Echinacea in a pleasant tasting blend of organic West Indian lemongrass leaf and organic spearmint.  Echinacea Plus has a serene and subtle lemon-mint flavor that is exceptionally comforting for colds, and soothing to scratchy raw throats.  Echinacea provides a slight tingle on the tongue due to the presence of alkylamides.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals recommends drinking 5-6 cups a days as soon as symptoms appear and then gradually reducing the dosage as symptoms improve.<br /><br />Numerous clinical studies have examined the effects of Echinacea.  Echinacea stimulates activity of cells that fight infection in our bodies and increases the number of these cells such as the white blood cells and lymphocytes. These immune cells attack bacteria, viruses and abnormal cells, including cancer.  Echinacea has a positive effect on wound  healing, lessens symptoms and speeds recovery from viruses.<br /><br />Echinacea also has anti-inflammatory properites which aids recovery from psoriasis and eczema and may help arthritis.  It also may increase resistance to candida, bronchitis and herpes and other infectious conditions.  Echinacea should not be used continually for any longer than 5-8 weeks."

Maybe I just got couple of old ones or something but the 2 of this flavor that I tried were as hard as rocks. I nearly broke my front tooth (at least it felt that way) biting into them. I do agree it tastes good once you get a bite off, but it's not worth the toothache.<br /><br />Try the other flavors, they are good but think twice about this one."

06	53085,B0000DCWWI,A1E37DNGUC3GCI,5/10/06,5,5,5,Holy crow! This sh*t is HOT!! (which is a good thing),"I bought a bottle of Dave's Insanity twelve years ago at a hot sauce store in Boulder, CO, back when Dave's was the hottest sauce made. One or two drops in a pot of soup made the whole thing damn near unbearable (yet my roommate managed to use half the bottle in around 2 months).<br /><br />So when I saw the salsa, I thought I knew what I was getting into. I assumed that the salsa would be pretty ungodly hot  but somehwat milder than the sauce, given that this contains OTHER ingredients like tomatoes and onions. Boy, was I wrong. This stuff is as hot as the Insanity sauce, even though it is ""diluted"" with salsa ingredients. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. The heat won't kill you, and it won't even cause any real damage. (It'll just feel that way.)<br /><br />Don't expect to empty the jar at the same rate at which you scarf down that chipotle corn salsa or the green olive tomatillo tapanade, though. I eat a little bit of this everyday with tortilla chips and sour cream, sprinkle a tiny amount on a plateful of nachos, and spread an 1/8 teaspoonful on quesadillas, and have for the last three months. I think the salsa level has decreased by a few tablespoons in that time, and to me that seems like progress.<br /><br />Good stuff, but only for committed chileheads (or, more accurately, for those chileheads who should be committed)."

Judging by the package outside, it's like a regular brown box, no fancy tin.  But, the tea is individually wrapped in some soft satin materials and you can see the little tea leaves.  Then, each is wrapped in a plastic to maintain freshness !!  I was blown away by the packaging already at this point.  Then the tasting began, it's such a smooth, delicate tea - I can't describe how nice it is but I quit the cheap lipton or any other brand.  This is the tea for me."

The Rouille is spicy, that I deducted just from looking at the angry orange color in the jar, the color of auburn harvest on a stormy night. The taste is of cream immersed in a sea of chili peppers and garlic with a peppery background. My favorite way to eat it is in a sandwich with a leftover cold coconut breaded chicken cutlet with some crisp romaine in between two toasted crusty slices of bread smeared on the inner sides with the Rouille spicy mayonnaise . The taste is a tropical rendition of a Caesar Chicken Sandwich I get at Hale and Hearty here in NYC but much easier since I made it at home and it took no effort.<br /><br />Great on bread, meat or as a condiment to any afternoon snack or smeared on some California roll for a spicy finish. There is no end to the amount of uses this product provides.<br /><br />- Kasia S."

I would definately order this product again and am willing to try some other green teas by Davison."
06	51192,B0018CG3IW,A2Z9R58PDJJET9,11/4/06,1,1,5,Great Dog Treats,These dog treats are great.  Our dog loves them!  They're on the smaller size as far as dog biscuits go - shaped like peanuts in the shell (and are a little larger than the actual size of a peanut).  We particularly like them because they fit perfectly into a medium sized Kong toy - and because they are shaped like a peanut - you can shove them so they get kind of stuck in the Kong and it takes the dog a while to get it out.
06	41548,B000FNADGI,A5DFQGZFLHGMJ,6/14/06,3,3,5,Wow!  Cheese crackers that taste good!,"Ever try the goldfish crackers?  They taste as much like the box as they do cheese.  The TLC Country Cheddar crackers are far superior.  They taste of cheddar and the texture balances smooth with crunchy, and savor for a few seconds to soften and get the cheddar flavor.  It's not too sharp or too mild - just right.  My favorite TLC cracker is Honey Sesame, but I eat the other varieties regularly to keep things interesting."

Perhaps he does it just to let me know that he needs more attention or maybe he does it to piss me off.  Poop Freeze has saved the day!  It makes picking up poop easy and fun.  Did I say fun - YUP.  My kids love picking up after the dog outside in the yard with Poop Freeze.

I have tried Dr. McDougall's Non-Dairy Peach and Raspberry Hot Cereal before, and loved it. Maple Hot Cereal is very flavorful, hearty, and filling!<br /><br />I love Dr. McDougall's products, because they are so natural, with whole grain raw oats (not processed, instant oats), and use soy milk powder to give a creamy texture with out all of the added sugars that normal oatmeal products have.<br /><br />Also, this oatmeal is wonderful, because of the portion size. A usual instant oatmeal packet is skimmpy on size- I usually need two packets for breakfast. This product, however, is a good portion size, and it is convenient because you don't need a bowl to mix it (you use the product container itself, and just add water).<br /><br />Dr. McDougall's Non Dairy Hot Cereal products are the greatest store bought, and the closest to homemade oatmeal you can get!"

A great source of Omega-3 oil, you can improve your health by eating these tasty, nutty seeds. They are good for the gut and good for the heart.<br /><br />The golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. They look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. They taste the same as the dark seeds. Ground, they don't show up in white bread, so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber.<br /><br />We like them sprinkled on oatmeal, muesli or yogurt."

Fortunately, we found Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Bars fairly soon after their diagnoses.  The kids think they are delicious, and I love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most ""treats"".  They are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party, the kids can just grab a bar, and take it with them so they aren't left out when cake is served.  I give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school, my kids still get their treat.  The fact that my kids consider them a special treat, they must really be yummy, although I have yet to try them myself.  BTW, we tried a few other flavors of Nana's bars and cookies, but this one is the only one my kids like (or should I say love)."
06	51441,B000168O3I,A26A64X86VL1R4,3/25/06,0,0,5,Refreshing and wholesome!,"This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface."
06	30093,B000DZFMEQ,AHA3EU8E216Z6,8/27/06,56,59,5,It does make an AMAZING bread !!!,"This past December my 7-year old son was diagnosed with allergic to wheat. This is a little guy that LOVES bread !!! He is also allergic to dairy. So, I searched and tried many kinds of wheat free bread mix/recipes and he might eat 2 bites and then stopped with sad face or he would cry. He said ""it's yucky, grainy, tasted bad..."". I often hid my tears, 'cause I knew I needed to be strong for him. Once I even ordered a bread from a bakery chef, $6.50/loaf, and my son took one bite and that's it!<br /><br />Then in June I checked out Amazon, and found this product. The review said it's moist and not grainy, and I was so desperate, so I ordered a box of 6! That ended my search!!<br /><br />When I put the 1st loaf on the dining table, my son could not stop eating it (and of course, I cried secretly in the kitchen!). I also ordered the cake mix, and chocolate chip cookies mix. I can't express how thankful I am to see my son's bright eyes as he enjoys his bread. By the way, I like it too. Thank you to the people that make Pamela's Products !!!!"

06	4037,B000CMHMUC,A3TVM89UYT3BPK,12/20/06,15,15,5,Reboot your snack processors,"I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time).  I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know...""I thought you said 5 stars.""  It gets better.)<br /><br />Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.<br /><br />Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking!"

I discovered this blend at one of our local groceries, but they are not consistent in stocking it.  It sells out quickly and then may not reappear for weeks.  And it is the only store in town that carries it.  I was thrilled with the opportunity to buy it by the case online.  The price is very competitive with the local grocery, and shipping was fast.  This is easily one of the best rice blends I have found.  And it is NOT seasoned, so you do not have to contend with high sodium content or other problems. You make it the way you want it--cook it in broth, add vegetables & herbs and some diced chicken or leftover beef for a quick skillet meal that is head & shoulders above a boxed skillet dinner. We all really love this rice--the blends of rice give it a nice texture and taste and it is so much healthier than white rice, yet it cooks as quickly.  Try this one--you will like it!"

The taste is ricey and bland, and it falls apart despite following the cooking directions.  There are many good wf/gf pasta products out there these days, but this isn't one of them."

I've been taking this product for breakfast and lunch at work since about September 2005, and I'm not sick of it yet.  Not even close.  I'll consume as much as I want during the day when I want.  I feel completely full for a few hours with one drink. I mix it in a 20 ounce bottle with two scoops.  Your body will appreciate the health benefits of this drink, unlike fried or fast food that will take down your energy level and leave you feeling groggy.  You will lose weight also from taking this product.  I lost 20 pounds and am now at a level of maintaining my current weight, and I owe a lot to Naturade Soy.  I've also tried the Vanilla flavor.  I was not impressed. Buy the Bavarian Chocolate and try it out.  You'll be glad you did."

If you're a fan of chocolate and raspberry, then you should try them. the raspberry is not too sweet and glossy, but not goopy. You can even taste a seed here and there, which I think adds to the authenticity. The chocolate is good, and the cookie is very cake-like. Plus, they are lower in fat than you would think two little chocolate raspberry cookies would be. I wish these cookies were as pretty as the one on the box, though!"
06	76842,B0005ZZ4B0,ADDY0B64M2QBW,10/5/06,0,0,5,Best Cookie EVER!,"I can't believe how good these cookies are.  A diet buster for sure!  PIMS is also made with dark chocolate & orange filling, which I prefer over the raspberry filling & milk chocolate.  I just wish they weren't so expensive or that a US manufacturer made such good cookies.  PIMS are a SURE crowd pleaser at holiday parties.  Put it out along side the Godiva chocolates.  They'll fly off the plate!"

The packaging keeps the rice fresh after opening so you don't have to transfer it to another container. The perfect side dish. Plus it cooks quickly. I plan to try the other RiceSelect blends offered.

It's one of the few herbal, caffeine-free beverages that packs a strong flavor.  If you like spicy flavors like hot cinnamon, you'll love this drink!  My only advice is to let it steep for a long time--maybe 15 minutes--and NOT to add too much water.  I like to use huge mugs for my drinks, but in order to fully enjoy this particular herb tea, you can't put more water than fits into a standard mug, say 6 to 8 ounces of boiling water per bag."
06	18950,B001AG9ZXG,A2YM2NM7YZA24Q,8/3/06,0,2,3,it tastes good but it's hard to notice any difference,"Years ago, when living on the east coast I suffered from asthma despite the fact that I was on four different medications.  After moving here to Arizona, I've been able to completely take myself off of all medications.  More recently however, my father passed away and apparently my emotional reaction triggered one of the worst asthma attacks I've had in years.  For the past two weeks, I've been gasping for air even after walking a short distance and could not even say a few words to people without gasping for air and panting.  My asthma became so bad this time that I contemplated going to the emergency room because I felt like I was going to pass out.  Instead what I did was do breathing exercises, bio-feedback, meditation and prayer.  While in the health food store I came across this tea, purchased it and staggered home to prepare it.  After drinking some, I noticed a little difference in breathing after about 30 minutes.  But I was thinking that it may not be the tea but simply because I sat down and relaxed for a while.  After drinking 3 or 4 cups of this tea a day using two tea bags, I honestly did not notice any significant difference in breathing.  The only thing significantly different was the fact that I started coughing up more flim, but that just could be that the asthma attack was running its course or the fact that I was drinking more fluids.<br /><br />The tea definately tastes good.  It has slight mint flavor which cools your mouth when the air is drawn in.  There is also a slight sweet and pleasant bitter taste to it.<br /><br />I quickly finished up two boxes of this tea.  I may buy some more later because I really like the taste.  As far as it treating asthma and other respiratory problems, it was simply hard to tell.  IF YOU ARE HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK, THIS TEA WILL NOT RESTORE FREE BREATHING.<br /><br />Only a few days ago, my asthma has been dramatically clearing up.  I worked out yesterday and am able to do strenuous exercise without panting and wheezing like I was doing last week.  I very seriously doubt that the tea had a delayed effect.  Last week, I didn't want to do it but I staggered into a drug store and purchased an inhaler (I hate using those things because they contain epinephrine).  I had two choices, either I keep suffering and kill myself or restore my breathing."

The frogs are made of a hard gummi, and are all green except for a thin white layer on the frogs' bellies. You might not recognize them as frogs unless you're told. There is no discernible taste or texture difference between the white and green substances, and in any case, the flavor is unidentified, unidentifiable, and not very good. It definitely is not lime, as advertised. Maybe somebody likes this stuff, but I didn't. I set the bag out at the office after my first sample."

Both of my toddlers have booty as a treat and beg for it. These bags are larger than I expected ~ turns out an ounce of Booty is the size of a chip bag. A bit much for a toddler (mom's opinion).

It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" version is not much more than pretty window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."

Believe it or not the Maxwell House T DISC is actually better, makes a more robust cup of coffee.  All the other T DISCs are fabulous - the espresso is just about as good as you would get from a commercial coffee shop.  Hot Chocolate is delicious.  Hopefully they will re-vamp the Gevalia Signature Blend to make it a better, stronger, more robust cup of coffee like their traditional ground blend."

You are most probably not aware what crap meats and fillers are used to produce the most popular name brand foods. They are expensive because of the advertizing. Canidae is not cheap either, but it is because of the quality ingredients. My sons Collie gets it since a few month, and now the fur is much shinier, the dog does not smell and it loves the food."

These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's RÌ»verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"

While hoping that they would have replaced the ""bad fat"" with a poly or mono unsaturated fat they have chosen to go with palm and coconut oil, two of the  nutritionally worst ""vegetable oils"", to make matters worse they fully hydrogenate these oils making the ratio of fat that is found in the cookies 86% saturated (6gm/7gm)!<br /><br />Nutritionally one could do better by picking almost any other cookie - so I'd recommend skipping this one."

It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word ""English,"" which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday ""work horse,"" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee."

She has a very delicate stomach and when she was diagnosed with gastrointestinal problems, we were concerned that she would never enjoy treats again.  What started as a trial became a standard purchasing item.  We give her no more than 3-4 per week and so far, so great.  The treat smells very good and it does justice to the ""natural"" descriptive."

A little bit of moisture would have gone a long way, and I'm experimenting with rehydrating them by putting a piece of lettuce in the bag overnight (in the fridge).  The results have been inconclusive as to whether this helps, with two of us having a split decision.  The teriyaki flavor is perfect...not too salty as I expected, and the taste, if rated separately gets 5 stars."
06	27572,B000FK52B2,A94EJ4NMTPHT0,12/6/06,71,71,5,A great option for vertical sprouting,"These smaller sized Sprout Master sprouters are great for smaller batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray dividers makes it easy to make small batches of as many as six different sprouts at a time. The larger tray would be better for big batches, but using these trays in concert can achieve the same effect. For most people (not feeding too large a family), I would suggest starting out with these and evaluating whether you often want to make larger batches than you can manage in a single smaller tray.<br /><br />There are four ""lids"" that come with this set and are all exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown).  With four lids and three trays you'll find it necessary to stack the trays if you want to cover more than one at a time. The Sprout Master's drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you've sprouted in a jar before, you'll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you'd need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it's more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you're cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The ""Easy Sprouter"" device doesn't have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it's shape. Neither is a very significant complaint, and I find that the Easy Sprouter gets sufficient light for most purposes."

06	69240,B0018KR8V0,A1V1LLQUE8A2NR,9/27/06,39,151,1,"""Health"" Does Not Always Equal Health","It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body."

My husband and I have been following the ""Eat to Live"" plan for about 4 months now.  I purchased this product to give the illusion of meat in my chili and marinara sauce.  Both my husband and I were dubious about how this product would taste and what the texture would be.  We were both pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have summarized my observations of this product below:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Very easy to use<br /><br />2. Can be stored in the cupboard while dry<br /><br />3. Texture is very similar to ground meat<br /><br />4. Absorbs the flavor of the sauce it is placed in<br /><br />5. Soy product, which is good for your health<br /><br />6. Good source of vegetable protein<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. It isn't going to fool anyone that it is beef or pork it used alone, but it does replicate the texture<br /><br />Overall I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a vegetable protein.  I have used it both in chili and marinara sauce.  I plan to try adding it to my lentil veggie burgers where I think it will work fine.  I have been pleasantly surprised by this product and would recommend it to anyone that is trying to reduce the saturated fat that his or her family is consuming.  If you aren't vegan I would suggest that you mix the rehydrated TVP into meatballs, and hamburgers.  I can't imagine that your family would even know that it is there if you used a 50/50 mix."

It's not like Tobasco sauce which is very hot and you sprinkle on items.  It's a different kind of sauce (I love Tobasco).  Frank's is a hot sauce you can use more liberally to your liking because, while it's hot, it's not so hot you can't really dig into it and enjoy the rich flavor and spices.<br /><br />I like to use this sauce to dip chicken tenders in, but you can also use it too cook buffalo wings, put it on eggs, French fries, burgers, whatever you like.<br /><br />This size really is way too small to purchase.

They are amazing! Sometimes simple and natural is better, and this is one of those cases. I far prefer these to any of the fancy energy bars like Luna Bars, Clif Bars, etc. They are simply nuts and dried fruit, they satisfy my sweet tooth and also give me the energy I need to get through the day.

WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />If you are a big chocolate lover, I would just warn you that these don't taste like a chocolate bar - the combination of cocoa and chili powder is really more like a Mole sauce you get in Mexican cooking - rich, but not at all sweet.

First off, the fragrance of strawberries was very strong and it is one of the most unusual flavors I have ever experienced.  In the long term, however, I found the green peppercorn flavor to be overpowering and I did not want to go back to have more chocolate since all I could think about was the green peppercorn.  Hope this helps.  It is definitely interesting and worth trying once, although I won't buy it again."

I've given this to people and not told them it's diet dressing, and haven't had anyone ask about it. If it were a non-diet dressing I'd give it 3 stars for flavor, but considering the small number of calories (the ""zero"" on the label means ""less than 5 per serving"" -- thanks, FDA) it's pretty impressive."

Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones."

As a previous poster has already said, many renal failure cats are presribed the Hill's k/d or a/d diets and they absolutely hate it and won't eat it. My cat would not touch the stuff -- wouldn't even smell it -- I had to force feed him for weeks. I finally found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet, which is almost as low protein/phosphorous as the Hill's prescription diets. My cat loves it and is finally gaining back some weight. The vet had also prescribed some vitamin drops, which he also hates. Then I found ""Vita-Gravy"", which is also available at Pet Food Direct. He loves the taste of the Chicken Vita-Gravy mixed with the Hi-Tor Neo. Now he's getting the extra nutrition he needs to balance his blood levels, while really enjoying the taste! If your cat has renal failure and is refusing to eat, you might want to try this combo. Good luck! I hope your kitty fares as well as mine has so far."

06	2898,B000F9Z1WI,A2NJO6YE954DBH,8/24/06,2,2,4,Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack,"We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the ""Oreo Biscuit"").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the ""modern"" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for ""hill""), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the ""cream"" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: ""Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees"").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit."

I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of ""A Star Is Born"" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

Rooibos is naturally caffeine free and high in antioxidants.  African Orange Mango is a strongly orange scented and flavored with a hint of mango aftertaste.  It has no sourness at all.  I think it would make a really nice ice tea.  It is a tasty brew that is almost as good as their Moroccan Pomegranate Red Rooibos tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!"

Sugar-free Protein shakes give you most of it. But you do like to get it from other sources also. You have a very small 1/8-1/4 cup stomach so you can't waste your space on snacks that can't benefit you with vitamins, proteins or some nutrient of value. Also, you can't eat sugar., but you can eat sugar substitutes. So KAY'S NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE GREAT! They have tons of protein and they taste great! These cinnamon toast pretzel sticks are great...the sweetener is low enough in the ingredient list to be able to tolerate it--because there isn't much of it. The white cheddar kruncheeze snacks are great also...they are like cheetos and you like to be able to have a snack when other people do. Also, the Thank you KAYS! You help us take casre of ourselves while we ENJOY food and make eating a little more normal. Lisa"

Liquid goat's milk is expensive, at least where I live, so we switched to the powdered form a few months ago.  I don't drink milk, but my son seems to like it okay.  Goat's milk products have a distinct flavor that you either love or hate; I love it in goat cheese and goat butter, but my wife hates it.  Judge for yourself!"

The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample."

06	2926,B000F9Z1WI,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,9/1/06,0,0,3,Not impressed,"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre."

The coconut-cashew dominate most of the flavor and texture of this delicious, rich and unbelievably nutritious bar. I had to keep reminding myself that it's organic, vegan, and raw, because it sure doesn't taste like what you'd expect something in that class of food to taste like! Don't pass on this bar whether you're into raw food or not. Superb."

These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable."

Yes, they are crunchy and spicy, but that is what I expect in a ginger snap.  They are wonderful to dip in milk.  The milk cools the spiciness and softens the cookie.

Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]"
06	62049,B000CQG8K8,AVE9KNJYJDESB,10/20/06,9,9,4,"Good, but mostly for Earl Grey fans","I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional ""full pot"" method of ""1 per person and 1 per pot"" (and for me, often ""1 extra just for the fun of it"") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them."

I drink alot of tea and this is what I drink....Try it, you'll like it!"

And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.<br /><br />I'd have to say skip these cookies.

The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, ""Humm these are good!""  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time."

06	22484,B00016AU3K,A1YUL9PCJR3JTY,10/15/06,11,11,4,"Delicious, Yes, May Help With Stress Relief","****<br />This Kava Stress Relief Tea from Yogi Tea is for anxiety relief. It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, ""Your breath is the voice of your soul"" and ""Your head must bow to your heart"".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. ""Kava-kava,"" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of ""relaxed unconcern"" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.""<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, ""Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.""<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />UPDATE: R. and Benjamin say in the comments that it is important to use hot but not boiling water as the boiling water may kill the part of the kava that helps one be relaxed. Please see my comment section for more information. Thanks to R. and Benjamin for their comments.<br />****"
06	62097,B000CQG8K8,A2PL4KZQJ0VFOB,12/20/06,2,2,3,"Over all, fairly good","I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better."

At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try."

I didn't have evaporated milk or I didn't want to look for it and made the recipe with just the eggs and spices.  One hundred percent pumpkin puree is a great idea!  Last month, purveyors in ""aristocratic"" New York were selling pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving for $50 each.  Considering how many Manhattanites and Brooklynites are originally out of towners who are not unfamiliar with canned food, I'm really amazed at how many rich people there are in New York City who are comfortable paying these prices.  We finally landed a perfectly acceptable 5-inch pie from Whole Foods supermarket that we didn't even finish - the price was $5.99.<br /><br />Some people may find this recipe too strongly spiced.  Wolfgang Puck's recipe is basically less of the spices and more eggs and milk to the same amount of pumpkin puree so that means one is at liberty to adjust the measurements as one pleases."

I have been seaching for a substitute but nearly every similar product contains varying amounts of caffeine.  Even decaf coffees and teas still contan a small amount of the drug.  Two months back I ordered two 100 bag boxes of Windsor and it has been a great substitue for my morning coffee.  I still miss that kick I got from my morning cup of coffee but that is one experience I do not wish to repeat.<br /><br />Coca tea has a very delicate taste but the taste is enhanced with a small amount of sugar is added.  Honey has such a distinctive flavor of its own that it would totally mask the flavor of the coca tea.<br /><br />I spent over two years in Bolivia with the Peace Corps and the tea brings back fond memories of my days in that country.<br /><br />Would I purchase the product again?  Yes!  In fact, I have already ordered two more boxes."

I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains ""delicious sasparilla"". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it."

It does not taste like an ""organic"" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the ""essence of mango"" you would smell from an air freshener.

06	2897,B000F9Z1WI,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,8/26/06,2,2,4,"Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out","As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!"

They are free of artificial preservatives, colors, and flavorings (natural Raspberry and Cranberry used) and are prepared in a nut free bakery for those with allergies and are suitable for vegans. They are lightly sweetened and crunchy and perfect with a cup of tea or glass of milk. I am not a health food junkie, but do like to have alternatives to some of the `junk' I at times crave.

They come out perfectly raised every time. I like to make these without any sugar in the batter. The flax makes it very bitter, but I like them like that with lots of butter. However, if you just add some syrup on top, it extinguishes the bitter taste on contact. Give these a try!"

Now it is one of my favorite Tasty Bites! Its very soupy - you definitely need to eat it from a bowl with a spoon. The taste is just out of this world - perfectly seasoned, rich and creamy - I don't know what it is, exactly but it makes my tongue just dance. I eat them for lunch, sometimes alone or with a vegetable, there isn't a lot in a packet but it's a good side dish size for one person too."

I don't like my chili spicey, and this one fit the bill exactly, as it has just the right amount of spices and herbs. I have tried a lot of chili, in a lot of places, and I will say that this is  the best MIX that I have ever tried. I would definitely recommend this for camping trips.

Somehow, I thought they would have a granola bar type of texture, but they aren't even close.  My first reaction was that they had an unpleasant smell and funny aftertaste - but that was my first reaction to beer, too, and I managed to get over that.  They are definitely an adult, acquired-taste kind of snack.  Now I look forward to having one as a mid-afternoon snack, depending on what I've already eaten or plan to eat that day, because they are a fairly high calorie (276), high fat (15g) little treat.

It's an unusual tea, slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. The good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. The bad news is that I can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea, although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. Still, it's a lovely cup of tea, and relaxing because it just tastes good. I can also taste the spiciness of the tea, which is very pleasant. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however, I even tried four bags once, but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. I am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway, so this is something to be aware of. Your experience of the tea may be different.<br /><br />Kava Stress Relief Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients in Kava Stress Relief Tea are: kava root extract, carob pod, Indian sarsaparilla root, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, stevia leaf, barley malt, natural hazelnut flavor, natural cinnamon flavor, and natural licorice flavor. Amazingly, I can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. I would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness.<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make. Their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like, ""Your breath is the voice of your soul"" and ""Your head must bow to your heart"".<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Kava Stress Relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress, anxiety and minor pain, as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. A member of the peppercorn family, Kava (Piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant, whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. ""Kava-kava,"" native to Oceania and the South Pacific Islands, has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind, and encourage a good night's sleep. A powerful antispasmodic, this herb promotes a state of ""relaxed unconcern"" while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. Furthermore, Kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* The Herb Research Foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety, stress, restlessness, muscle tension and mild pain. For added flavor, our formula has been complemented with Stevia, Sarsaparilla and Organic Carob. Enjoy a warm soothing cup of Kava Stress Relief, a delicious way to relax.""<br /><br />In addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, there is a warning on the box, ""Ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems, frequently use alcoholic beverages, or are taking any medication. Stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g., unexplained fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, dark urine, pale stools, yellow eyes or skin). Not for use by persons under 18 years of age, or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. Not for use with alcoholic beverages. Excessive use, or use with products that cause drowsiness, may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment.""<br /><br />Note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root, and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. However, I am not a physician, and if you have any health concerns, you should check with an appropriate professional.<br /><br />I decided to give Kava Stress Relief Tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. Still, it is a wonderful and recommended tea, and may work for you!<br /><br />****"

06	61242,B000HAAAKI,A35GBC9DGU1NRO,10/24/06,1,2,5,A great gourmet tea,"This tea is not the ""Cure for all Mankind diseases"" as many could be expecting, after three years commercializing this brand and other coca teas from Peru and Bolivia we have received all kinds of reviews, some people love it as an after meal tea, some do it to get away from coffee, some girls use it for menopause symptoms and others for PMS.<br />Several reviews we had can be used as evidence that coca products are good for backache, migraines and headaches.  I have also heard that many customers have consumed it to relieve depression or to reduce anxiety medication. In the other hand, some people do not experience any extra energy and only use it as a healthy herbal tea. It is impossible to expect that a simple tea bag with only one gram of dried - crushed coca leaves can be good for everybody and for everything! I just think is worth trying and see how your body reacts to it.<br />Personally, I have been using this tea since I am a kid for stomachaches and indigestion ( easy to get them when you are a chocolate's addict) and in the last years as ice tea while I workout or mixed with my protein shake for extra energy , it keeps me hydrated and my stomach surely enjoys it. So far I can use my same old Blue Jeans from 8 years ago but it is not all coca tea and coca products are not the miracle factor, I try to keep a healthy diet and I really try to workout at least 4 times at week.<br />Lately, I have added the coca flour to my kids diet in Bolivia, they are 10 years old twins, finicky eaters and their last medical showed them underweight and because coca is full of vitamins, minerals and calcium, I decided to give them some powdered coca every day. They get it in smoothies with yogurt and fruits, pudding, cake, bread, pasta and sauces and God knows all the recipes I have been trying the last weeks .......So far, my girl has shown a big weight improvement and I am hopping my boy can show that kind of progress in a near future."

It's also reasonably priced at around $15. Of course, the jelly beans are top notch and the unique flavors speak for themselves.<br /><br />This is an excellent gift item or treat for yourself."

But Texmati has all the fragrance of basmati rice, the fiber of brown rice and it comes in a wonderful clear square plastic jar that is great for filling with beans or popcorn when it is empty. This rice smells like pecans when cooking and tastes great. You can cook it up as pilaf with raisins, almonds and chicken or vegetable broth for a delicious side dish. Try it also by browning it in olive oil with a half cup of orzo per cup of rice and then make pilaf with broth. It is delicious."

06	69307,B0018KR8V0,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,4/1/06,2,2,5,"Tasty, but why aren't these organic?","If you squish together dates & bananas, mix in finely chopped almonds, form into bars, and dry the bars a bit so they're not too sticky, you basically have a Banana Cookie LaraBar.  I think they taste quite good for packaged bars and are healthier than most of the available food bars.  They taste like, well, bananas, dates, and almonds, with the almonds providing a bit of crunch.<br /><br />Although the ingredient list is only three words long, the wrapper text extolling the healthfulness and near-magical virtues of the bar is seven lines long.  To partially quote, ""Real food, raw food... No chemicals, no fillers, no medicinal tasting supplements.  LaraBar is never cooked.  Never Processed...[will] leave you with a pleasing sense of vitality and well being for hours to come.""  And there's more information on the wrapper, ""uncooked * unprocessed * no added sugar * non-GMO * gluten free * dairy free * soy free * vegan * kosher.""  The LaraBar website also tells you (in case you haven't figured this out) non-irradiated, no sulfites, and no colorings.<br /><br />All this is well and good, but if they're going to the trouble of making a bar that's so fabulously healthy for you, then it would be nice if they used organic ingredients.  Eating a bar made with conventionally grown (pesticided) fruit invalidates some of the healthfulness of the bar.  The bar tastes good, but in terms of healthfulness, I think LaraBar can do better.<br /><br />P.S. And what's with the two dots above the first letter A in Lara?  Do they want us to think it's an exotically Scandinavian product?  Like Haagen Daz, Lara bars are made in the U.S.A."

After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.  After 6 years I gave up trying.  Then I saw this mix in the store 2 years ago and got very excited with the prospects.  When I make the cake I tweak the mix recipe a little. I add to the dry mix 1/4 cup coco, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 raisins. I use 3 large eggs, 3/4 cup apple sauce, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/3 cup water instead of what is listed on the bag.  This cake and the chocolate cake mix also made by Namaste are our family's favorites.  This includes my husband and children who are not celiac and are VERY picky eaters!"

Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.  But it is the healthful ingredients and classic flavor that keep it an enduring favorite.  This caffeine-free herbal blend brews up into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart and tastes like minty cherry syrup.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

The Indomie products that I've tried (original, satay, and pedas) are all delicious. Make no mistake, not all oriental noodles do it for me. When our local Asian market ran out of Indomie, the owner told me to get a different brand that he promised I'd like better. I ended up throwing it out, because the taste was just awful. Indomie (original) however, has a mellow taste, with enough spice to keep you interested.<br /><br />This how noodles are done. Classic."

Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding."

I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.<br /><br />At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.<br /><br />During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their ""Gold Bears"" are the best.<br /><br />When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.<br /><br />I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.<br /><br />If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Edit: Nov 2, 2008 - When I wrote this review two years ago, Haribo was still quite difficult to find at grocery stores. It seems today that I can find them just about anywhere. In this case, Amazon still provides a really great deal on 5 lb bags. If you don't want 5 lbs, you can shop at a local grocery store.<br />But I must recommend this: if you will not eat all of the gummy bears right away, transfer them to an air tight container. If you leave the gummy bears exposed to the air, they will get very stiff after a while."

I sent the licorice and lemon flavors to my father, and he called me to ask where I'd gotten it, because his neighbor wanted to get some for his wife, too.  Once tried, you will be addicted.

They taste as good as can be expected from a powdered-cheese-based macaroni, and the individual pouches are convenient. Portions are a little small but not bad. Make sure you microwave it for as long as it says, though - it does not go well when only semi-cooked."

Import Foods also offers a full list of Thai receipes, along with a list of the ingredients needed, and the ability to simply click and order the needed items.  They offer an easy to use web buying experience and excellent quality products. I will definitely order from them again."

I knew I wasn't ready for VB, but I could certainly try out a new kind of cheese puff.  I previously thought that a day without Cheetos was a day wasted, so this was a big change.<br /><br />These are the best things ever!  They taste like real cheese and there's some variation in the intensity of the flavor - every single one doesn't taste exactly the same.  They aren't as crunchy as Cheetos and don't turn your fingers orange!<br /><br />After trying a couple bags purchased at the grocery store, I decided I loved them enough to invest in this 12-pack from Amazon.  Okay, so maybe I went a little wild and had a bag (or two) a day until they were gone - don't judge me!<br /><br />Try these out!  Buy a bag at the grocery store and then get the 12-pack.

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."

Besides rice flour, it also contains rice bran, which I guess is supposed to give it a texture closer to wheat pasta.

Pirate's Booty makes a healthy and satisfying alternative to run-of-the-mill deep fried potato or corn chips.  As a snack, they leave you with a full but not heavy feeling.  The danger is that they're so good, it's easy to eat the whole bag without realizing it.  I'd recommend taking a few out of the bag at a time and putting the rest out of sight.

I looked at most natural foods but she is allergic to salmon, lamb and carrots.  That eliminated most of the options out there.  I was so glad to find this food.

It is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk, but without the calories."

This provides an experience of, well, repugnance, at least for me; I've never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose, and this surely ain't converting me. ESPECIALLY when they're in the same bite/handful. Ugh.<br /><br />Otherwise, this mix is really yummy. It all tastes rather waxy, and I'm sure is not the healthiest food in the world (though you could do worse), but its a well combined mixture.<br /><br />But then again, I've got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace, because I must grab a handful, and then separate the rejects. Maybe I'm just neurotic, or maybe they made A FATAL MISTAKE AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED.<br /><br />Oh yeah, like the last reviewer, I too got 'em at Costco."

I am pleased that they offer the US FDA recommended daily allowance of vitamin C, which I suspect would make parents favor these over other snacks containing a higher number of ""empty calories.""<br /><br />I honestly didn't expect to like these very much, as I thought they would taste far too artificial. General Mills did an excellent job getting the flavors right. The orange flavor in the shape of Velma and the blueberry flavored Scooby are the most realistic flavors, though all are quite good. I wouldn't exactly call this health food, but these chews are great tasting and have essentially no fat, making them a good choice for a quick, light snack."

It is excessively orange flavored, overwhelming the cranberry flavor. My guess is that they added too much orange flavor to the recipe. It also crunches, due to the second ingredient (puffed rice). I don't think the puffed rice crunch adds anything to the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie, although at a moderate level of sweetness, has a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not a bad cookie, but it's not particularly good either, and one I won't be buying again. IMO, it's not worth the 260 calories one gets from eating both halves.<br /><br />P.S. Only the first ingredient, the whole wheat flour is organic."

This is a better alternative to cheetos or other junk food, but I would not condsider it healthy--just a better-tasting, more natural junk food.  It is satisfying and, based on the ingredients and taste, I'd rather eat Pirate's Booty than cheetos.

I'm not sure it survived shipping very well.  It was moist when we got it, but there was only one bloom left on it which dropped after one week.  I didn't care for it any differently than the Jade, which sits right next to it on the counter.  The only thing it seems to attract is bugs.

Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]"
06	62312,B000CQG8KS,AVE9KNJYJDESB,10/20/06,9,9,4,"Good, but mostly for Earl Grey fans","I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional ""full pot"" method of ""1 per person and 1 per pot"" (and for me, often ""1 extra just for the fun of it"") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them."

I purchased a bag of these Barry Farm strawberries, and I was so amazed by their pure flavor and soft texture that I came back for more ... and more!  Barry Farm must choose berries at their peak of ripeness because the berries are rich in pure strawberry flavor with a perfect consistency. I am particular about the food I buy, and I want good quality.  Why bother to bake something with inferior ingredients?  I would highly recommend Barry Farm Dried Strawberries to anyone.

Rice, with some vegetables mixed in, also some chicken. The chicken and veggies are chopped up into small pieces, and all of it is cooked in a pan, and served warm. It is really good, but what really makes it is the Salsa Lizano, which used to be on every table in Costa Rico, now you may have to ask for it, as it is really popular. This salsa is great on cabbage, chicken, rice dishes, just about anything. I always made a point of bring a bottle or two home with me, as it was not possible to purchase anywhere in America.<br /><br />  Trust me, try some of this stuff, you will not regret it. Also, it is not what I would consider a hot sauce. Sure it has a little heat, but very mild."

They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again."
06	62360,B000CQG8KS,A2PL4KZQJ0VFOB,12/20/06,2,2,3,"Over all, fairly good","I have tried spiced chai tea, but it did not have enough spices. I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better."
06	6452,B000FNEX50,A1G2KWKK44V3CV,9/20/06,7,7,5,From a person with a very limited diet,I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote in their review.  I gave the cookies a rating of 5 stars though because i havent eaten a cookie in about 4 years without getting sick.  This is because I have severe allergies to wheat and soy.  Pretty much every cookie you will find in a normal grocery store will have one if not both of these ingrediants.  So when I found Nana's cookies I was as happy as can be.  Yes the texture is different than a wheat cookie but it's better than going without cookies.  It also doesnt hurt that these cookies are delicious.  If you are like me and have a very limited diet these cookies are  a very welcome addition to that diet.

Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake ""cheez"" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items."
06	6031,B001E2FMLK,A3F3B6HY9RJI04,7/20/06,3,3,5,Gave me a boost when I needed it,"I had a very long day. Got to work early, worked about nine hours, headed for the airport and had to go through a connecting flight and about 5 hours of travel. And when I got home I still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it.<br /><br />After hearing a radio ad for this product, I picked up a two-pack and used one of them when I got home.<br /><br />It promised five hours of energy without crashing. I can't attest to the five hours (didn't quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn't overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.<br /><br />The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don't like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn't fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.<br /><br />I've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead. Otherwise, Chaser has a new, steady customer."

It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br /><br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br /><br />****"

Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history."

All you have to do is open the bag and smell what's inside.  It smells so good, you might be tempted to try one too.<br /><br />We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs, this bag really is a cost saver.

Our 17 year old cat (Angel) was diagnosed with renal failure and the vet put her on food that she would not eat.  That forced us to mix the vet food with other cat food and Angel still lost weight.  Angel is a very small cat and has weighed approximately 6-7 pounds her entire life.  When her weight dropped to 5 pounds we thought she was on her way out.  We purchased this food and she LOVES it!  Angel has been on it for about 6 months now and she is back to her normal weight. She begs for it. What an awesome product!

When the mayonnaise arrived, the ingredients had separated out. It looks absolutely disgusting, and doesn't do much to inspire confidence that I won't get very sick consuming this mayonnaise. I'm not sure if this has been anyone else's experience, but I, for one, will not be ordering mayo online again. Incidentally, this product is, like all grocery products, ineligible for return, so I'm stuck with six bottles of eggwhites and vinegar."

At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try."
06	5234,B0012YEKCW,A1XUOGZ07A2QKS,7/9/06,42,42,4,"easy to grow, my cats love it",Cat grass seeds will sprout very easily---you can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture retaining soil or peat moss.  My cats eat the sprouts very quickly.  I suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs.  I did so to insure that I would have more sprouts ready when the first wave was gobbled.  The only drawback is shipping cost--which is more than the seed packets themselves.  That's another reason to order in multiples.  The shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet.

Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding."

I also find this to be heartbreaking as I do not know what to do with all my Starbucks that I have on hand. I just gave 3 pounds of my Starbucks to my mother-in-law since I will not be drinking it anymore. If you are a true coffee conesseiur then you will love Illy coffee. If I ever open a coffee shop, I would be more than happy to invest in this company."

It's been three months since his last bath (I just brush him) and no smell with Canidae!  My 6mo old Chihuahua was on IAMS for puppies but kept sneeking the Canidae from my Dingo.  So now he eats it too.  They scaf it down like crazy.  Buzz the Dingo's weight has improved without starving him.  This is the best dog food.  The price is good here although I buy it at the pet store.

Buying them from Amazon with our prime shipping is so much cheaper than buying them from our local grocery store.  Nuts keep nicely in the freezer.  Toasting them in a 350 degree oven for 10-12 minutes makes them taste gourmet-ish."

06	57715,B000EVOSE4,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,10/7/06,26,28,5,Nice little treat for the kids--and yourself,"These gummis are by far the best; the taste is tart and sweet, and the consistency is yes, gummy but not sticky. The bears resist the teeth with a pleasant rubbery consistency. And the outside is lightly dusted to prevent sticking together--however, they will melt with high temperatures in the Texas summer. They are nice mixed in trail mix for hiking, by the way.<br /><br />A five pound bag is a lot, but if you pack a few every day in the kids' lunch bags, they will disappear. They are great for teaching counting, too. Or getting things done. Put a bowl of gummis out and an empty bowl next to it. When one task is done, put a gummi in the empty bowl. At the end of your list, eat the gummis. Yummi."
06	55461,B000EGUYOM,A1E7BYP6JGDUHD,8/13/06,10,11,4,not as good as the almond crunch,"For me, at least, the almond crunch by Mrs. Mays is perfection in a snack, so it is hard to beat.  The pumpkin crunch seemed to have a little bit of a smokey flavor when you first bite in, which was surprising to me (though I have not really had many pumpkin seeds as a snack before), and I was expecting a bit more sweetness to it, similar to the almond crunch.  Overall, this is a great snack, and very addictive once you start munching!  You can tell that Mrs. Mays uses high quality ingredients in their snack foods, making for a great, healthy, tasty snack!"

They are vegan, so no dairy, eggs or other animal products. They are also fruit juice sweetened and made with whole grains. Absolutely nothing artifical. They have little chocolate chips in them and taste yummy! I'm so glad that Amazon carries them because they are much cheaper to buy by the case then at local health food stores or through the company website."
06	6461,B000FNEX50,A2158Y2U61AU9G,9/6/06,4,5,2,Weird texture; too dry and crumbly...,"I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are ""No Gluten"" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again."

I tried the fruit and nut ones also, and while I like those too, the all nut one (""Nut Delight"") is my favorite of the two."
06	28804,B000FFVYF0,ADA27F279TGTM,11/2/06,4,4,5,Healthy food can taste good.,"I like these bars because they are all natural and I feel like I'm getting a snack while still eating healthy.  The sugar grams are a little high, but at least they're coming from natural sources (honey, glucose) and not refined sugars.  They're not TOO sweet... they just taste very natural - like you dipped mixed, raw nuts into honey and ate it.  They're very crunchy and satisfy hunger cravings very well.  I love to get these at Borders bookstore as a nice healthy snack option while I'm out shopping.  I looked here to try some of the other flavors, but I'm hesitant to stray from the Nut Delight because it seems the other Kind bars have more saturated fat and more grams of sugar.  The Nut Delight seems like the best option of the bunch."

Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea.

At the store where I normally shop here one can is almost $5 so this was a fantastic deal. I liked how they were lightly salted and not as salty as alot of nuts are.<br /><br />I agree with the other review that they were mostly almonds. Id say 60% almonds, 30% cashews and 10% macadamias but they were still quite good."

AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate. However, we will probably opt to order Thai takeout for fresh noodles next time we have a craving."

For those of us who have dietary restrictions, it's a different story.<br /><br />It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare, but these cookies are among the best I've had, which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them.  And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things).  I just wish more stores carried them.

We used to buy individual bags at Whole Foods but they are expensive and get eaten too quickly.  My 1 year old son just loves them and they are great for his self feeding skills.  My 8 year old loves them as afterschool snacks.  My husband and I enjoy them - but we try not to eat too much since these are snacks afterall and we should not have too much junk food.<br /><br />A few months ago, we shipped a box to my father in law in CA. because he got addicted to them while visiting us.  He took a few bags to visit his mother in Wyoming and she got hooked.  When she could not find any in her very small town, my father in law shipped a box from Amazon to her.  That should last her for a while since she is 96 and lives alone.<br /><br />As you can see, this is addictive so be careful with buying your first box!!  We have also tried Smart Puffs, Cannon Balls and Veggie Puffs. The green Veggie Puffs did not go over as well with my family.  Only my 1 year old son likes it!"
06	42368,B000F0FX52,A94EJ4NMTPHT0,12/6/06,63,63,5,An excellent option vertical sprouting,"This is the larger size of the Sprout Master sprouter, great for larger batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray divider makes it easy to make larger batches or separate smaller sprout batches. Half of this tray still has more capacity than the whole of one of the Sprout Master small trays. If you're growing for one or two people I would recommend the ""Sprout Master Mini Triple"" instead. Coming with three trays the mini triple would allow you to grow a more diverse or more staggered crop.<br /><br />The two ""lids"" that come with this tray are exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown). The Sprout Master's drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you've sprouted in a jar before, you'll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you'd need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it's more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you're cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The ""Easy Sprouter"" device doesn't have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it's shape. Neither is a very significant complaint, and I find that the Easy Sprouter gets sufficient light for most purposes."

06	27300,B000J36EQC,A26A64X86VL1R4,3/16/06,0,0,5,The classic!,"Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation."" Oscar Wilde."

I general keep at least half a box of it around at all times, because it is a wonderfully flavored tea that my friends enjoy and it is something they will drink no matter what particular blend I might be brewing for myself.<br /><br />With a little bit of honey, it makes a nice medium bodied tea for a cold night whose mint helps to open the sinuses and the soothe the throat. Cooled with ice in a tea glass, it is an extra refreshing drink that fits right in on a summer day. It is this versatality that demonstrates how well this blend is balanced. It tends to stay away from bitterness even on over steeping, so it is easier to adjust to a strength you like without having to resort to milk to round the edges.<br /><br />And, to better justify buying it the ""Amazon six-pack"", it has a good long shelf life and it keeps its flavor strong for a couple of years."

I wanted something different than just white bread for sandwiches. I hate whole wheat. I love rye. I saw these, noticed the ingredients couldn't get much simpler and gave them a try. Topped with cheese, or a sandwich spread or whatever you'd like they're very tasty. I feel as full after 2 or 3 of these, topped of course, as I did with just white bread. They're nice and thin so it isn't like biting into anything hard - just a nice crunch. The flavor isn't strong at all - it is very mild and nothing like a rye bread you might have purchased in the past. Then I noticed that they are only 20 calories per slice. What's not to love? They taste good, they're whole grain, they're super low in calories, it's no crunchier than a potato chip, and I feel satisfied while chewing and after eating them. Oh - and they keep forever in the cupboard. I definitely will be buying these for a long time. :)"

There is a very nasty, artificial acrid, too citrusy, while at the same time too sweet, taste to these products. The strawberry margherita mix has a very faint taste of strawberry, but no amount of doctoring could make it drinkable.  I poured the mix out.  The Mai Tai mix -- poured it out.  I bought several bottle/dry drink mixes of all their varieties without trying them first.  BIG MISTAKE!  I am either going to pour them out or throw them out, since the folks at Baja Bob's web site have refused to even respond to my request that I return the unopened products for a refund.  You will also note that on their web site's ""fan club"" page, there are 0 entries.  Save your money unless you are totally desperate.  You'd be better off using Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit.  Now, that tastes pretty good mixed with Vodka."

I poured both of my two bottles down the drain. You would have to be pretty desparate, or otherwise never have had a decent margarita if this was your choice. I would rather skip altogether, as one of the other reviewers had suggested as well. The market has a long way to go to support less sugar in drinks."

I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact.  Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service."

I was wrong. It's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating. I did not taste cashews or almonds at all. Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items.

Not a pleasant experience.  I didn't finish either of them."

Then I stored them in the refrigerator since gluten free home baked goods are notorious for molding.  I ate one straight out of the frig and it was great!  I guess the flavors melded together after being stored a few hours.  I finished the batch one at a time out of the frig without re-heating any of them.  They were so good that way I couldn't bring myself to try them any other way.  :)<br /><br />Our family has been navigating the area of gluten free eating for over 10 years.

These brownies have a fudgy texture and have bits of chocolate chips in them which are delicious.  I would say the mix is very thick and a little difficult to work with.  The cooked brownies are slightly difficult to cut into very neat edges as the edges tend to crumble a little and I would also say that they make a slightly thinner layer of brownies than most of the store brand gluten containing but they taste just as good, if not better.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />(For those wondering, this mix requires 2 eggs OR 4 egg whites and 7 tbs melted butter to prepare.  They do have suggestions for lactose free and low fat preparations)"

I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child, so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine, I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways, thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor, but I just couldn't do it! Well, that is just my 2 cents.

The cake is almost as good as if you baked it in the oven only much quicker and easier. All you have to do is add water to the mix, stir together, squeeze the carmel from the packet onto the cake and put it in the microwave for approx. 1 min. and 15 seconds and you have a decent cake without the trouble, time and mess of making a full size cake mix.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be glad you did."
06	52574,B003ANFMY8,A1MV5ATV8WXXRO,7/25/06,1,6,3,Not tastey,"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try."

We used Good Start Soy so far. Very recently we upgraded to Good Start 2. No problems at all. The best time for this upgrade is when your baby is on first foods for a while. but not eating enough of it. Our pediatrician recommended frequent feedings. That works semi-successfully for the day-time with attention and mood problems. During night, especially before sleep-time, feeding of Good Start 2 is very effective to put him down for 6 hrs at least. (We have one very active baby). Good Start 2 has worked out as a very effective strategy to fill the nutrition gap.<br /><br />It is not very easy to find big cans and even small cans of Soy products in popular superstores and grocery chains. If you do, the price varies as much as $3-$5 per can from one place to the other. Amazon's 24 Oz. 6-pack is the best deal with free shipping. You pay about 84 cents per ounce. If you go for one size bigger 6-pack 25.6 Oz cans, you pay 93 cents per ounce."

I also tried a mix where you just add water, but they were too sweet. I prefer a stronger spice flavor and I like to be able to control the amount of milk and sugar. So, I usually make my own chai spiced tea from scratch. I get just the right amount of ingredients, but it is a lot of trouble and takes time.<br /><br />Then I tried the Stash Double Spiced Chai Tea. With more spice than most other teas I found the flavor and intensity to be fairly close to my home-made chai. This chai tea is able to maintain the flavor of the black tea with a nice blend of spices that give it a little extra kick with the double-spice. Of course, with more spices comes more bitterness. The way to lessen the bitterness is to slightly increase the milk and sugar. A better way to help cut the bitterness is to use honey instead of sugar.<br /><br />I will still make my own home-made version when I have the time to make it. But, I will also use this Stash Double Spice Chai Tea as an alternative until I find something better."

Yes, they have a unique taste at first, but I'm oddly attracted to these critters now! I say to give 'em a try...I'm addicted."
06	60136,B00099XOQE,A2KC1UCQYX0G3L,11/19/06,4,4,5,Delicious!,"I've purchased this many times, and since the beginning, I've always enjoyed it. If you follow the directions correctly, you can create a delicious afterschool snack for the kids, or as a pasta side for dinner. I highly recommened this product."
06	60138,B000EDG598,A4U5468S4SOJH,9/13/06,47,47,5,Great product -- use it to make wheat-free flour substitute!,"I can't eat any kind of wheat flour, but since I discovered Almond Meal (Bob's Red Mill), my diet is much easier to live with. I use 4 parts almond meal with 4 parts garbanzo (bean) flour and 1 part potato starch (NOT potato flour)as a substitute for regular flour. I've made brownies, peanut butter cookies, banana bread, and carrot cookies and found the texture and taste are not noticeably different than the original recipe, at least to me."
06	7685,B001E5DZTS,A2158Y2U61AU9G,7/29/06,12,15,5,Great product!,"My three-year-old daughter has been drinking this brand of goat milk for the last 2 years because she is dairy intolerant.  This is a great product. Easy to carry (because it's a powder) and mix it when you need it.  And, this is an awesome price. $10.00 less than I usually pay for three cans."

A little bit of moisture would have gone a long way, and I'm experimenting with rehydrating them by putting a piece of lettuce in the bag overnight (in the fridge).  The results have been inconclusive as to whether this helps, with two of us having a split decision.  The teriyaki flavor is perfect...not too salty as I expected, and the taste, if rated separately gets 5 stars."
06	60142,B000EDG598,A3QWPNDJ7ET7BL,6/18/06,13,14,5,So versatile and tasty,"Bob's Red Mill is a reliable and inexpensive source for gluten-free baking products. And yes, almond flour makes delicious, rich, nutty baked goods. But did you know you can also use it in place of bread crumbs? Bread chicken or fish with it, stuff mushrooms with it, there is no end to its versatility."
06	59366,B000FBM3RC,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,7/28/06,2,2,5,excellent superlight substitutes for palmiers,"Many of Bahlsen's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste, but these light flaky cookies don't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard.  I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price."
06	29108,B0001FQV5C,A26HFSVLAGULIM,2/20/06,21,23,5,BEST KIND OF OIL WITH THE MOST IMPRESSIVE CREDENTIALS,"IN A NUTSHELL: Recently I have begun using this brand exclusively. Here's why.<br /><br />""COLAVITA - EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL"" has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:<br /><br />-----*- Certification from the ""I.S.O."" - ""International Standardization Organization""<br /><br />-----*- ""Certified Authentic Product of Italy"", where the best olives for olive oil are grown under the best conditions<br /><br />-----*- Natural product, just olive oil - nothing added<br /><br />-----*- Excellent full-bodied taste<br /><br />What are the nutritional components?<br /><br />A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the fat in olive oil is monounsaturated and nine percent (9%) is polyunsaturated fat; fourteen percent (14%) is vegetable-derived saturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain the antioxidants beta-carotene and Vitamin E, as well as the phenolic compounds tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol.<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their ""Extra Light"" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the ""Mediterranean"" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of ""mono-saturated fats"" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $7.00 for 17 ounces [.5 liter]. Bear in mind, that Olive Oil will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Stored correctly, Olive Oil will stay fresh for up to 2 years. Smaller containers like this 17-ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the gallon, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is ultimately what its all about.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY.]"

06	1538,B000E7WM0K,A3S47IH20RNWHK,11/28/06,1,1,3,Needs a little something,"Overall, this was good, but not great.  The ginger sauce seemed like it need an extra something to get it a fourth star.  I think I was expecting a little more ginger taste.  I'd buy it again, especially if I can find a good way to punch it up just a little more.  I may try that egg tip!"
06	51361,B0014UAHQM,A3DV8VDX9SAHWD,12/5/06,2,2,5,Mixes Easy and Taste Just like sugar!,It mixes very easy and tastes great without an aftertaste. I highly recommend it.
06	1539,B000E7WM0K,A24FTIZ8U0TI6U,11/9/06,1,1,4,Really good!,"The Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger Noodles are really yummy! The coconut and ginger flavors are very mild.<br /><br />Each recloseable, Chinese-takeout-shaped box conveniently serves as a microwaveable container. One box makes enough for me to have 2 very filling lunches or for my whole family to share as a side dish. (The kids always lunge at the opportunity to have these!)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say is that I wish there weren't so many separate little seasoning packets to mix in (3, plus the noodles); a single combined spice packet would be easier. (Of course, one benefit of multiple packets is the ability to leave out a certain spice if you're not fond of it, but I like them all!)"
06	61463,B001EO5R04,A1G31ONMDUNNQ7,9/12/06,3,5,5,Great tea,"My husband's favorite loose green tea.  He drinks every morning, and it is a little better price than from Stash."
06	63293,B00014D6YW,AG9MOS64WEA5K,5/14/06,2,3,4,Good For Mild Detox,"The taste of this tea will take some getting used to - it's a bit peppery and warm, and you can taste a tiny bit of licorice in it. Sounds disgusting, I know, but it isn't bad - just...odd. I've heard that it helps with recovery from colds and mild illnesses, though I haven't tried it for that purpose myself. As for the ""detox"" effects, they're extremely mild and you likely won't notice any physical difference (except for increased energy, perhaps)."
06	86384,B000FIP7XW,A2LYRRWF5UZ2WO,7/31/06,2,2,5,Yummy!,"This cookie is fabulous!  Its crunchy, its lightly lemony, and low in calories!  What more can you ask for.  Little one love them too!"
06	61465,B001EO5R04,A2PQ0UMRCFKQF7,11/8/06,1,2,3,nice organic Assam,Satisfactory but not completely satisfying as some other tea growers' Assams are but priced reasonably.
06	40659,B00142EAKO,A26A64X86VL1R4,5/21/06,0,0,4,Reminiscent of Moroccan tea!,"This refreshingly smooth decaf brew leads with spearmint flavor and scent with a trace of peppermint.  Decaf green tea provides pleasant robustness to the blend without being overpowering, as well as providing healthy antioxidants. Reminiscent of Moroccan tea. A favorite!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""No bird soars too high with his own wings.""  William Blake"
06	1373,B00068PCTU,A25XCB9AMF34AE,3/8/06,7,7,5,White Stevia 12 Oz Pwdr,Great product!<br /><br />The Stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural.<br /><br />Use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar.<br /><br />Tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.
06	33829,B0002DJFUQ,A3EMHRN12JAHDH,7/28/06,9,11,1,Please Read Label,"I bought these for my two small dogs. A day after they had them,both acted ""off"" ,they refused to eat their canned dog food(Wellness).The only thing different in their daily schedule was the Petrodex Dental Chews. I read the label,it states ""wash hands after handling"". If there is something so toxic in these chews that I must wash my hands after handling,I sure do not want my dogs chewing and eating them.They are in the garbage.If I could have awarded zero stars,I would have.I am going to stick to the Breath Brushers made by Zuke's.

No bacon, no cheese...just tasty potatoes.  They cook well in either the oven or microwave.  I add a touch of either salt & pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up.  I rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion.  However, this item is a fairly good value for the money."
06	69676,B003CK7O36,A2ASW24UL56E3H,7/29/06,1,10,3,Meh...,"I tried this product to see if I could make creamy, starbucks quality spiced chai at home and was underwhelmed.  A much better product is provided through Mocafe, Precious Divinity Spiced Chai powdered mix."
06	68583,B000E63LOM,AXAJXJZUL2J5P,6/22/06,18,18,5,Great tea at a great price,"This is an unexpectedly enjoyable tea.  The mate gives it a deeper and woodier taste than black tea alone, with just a hint of smokiness.  While that might not sound particularly appetizing, it's actually quite good.  However, I ONLY like it with a squirt of lemon juice (and sweetener).  Without lemon juice, I don't enjoy it, but I have to have lemon juice in my plain tea, as well.<br /><br />The flavor is distinctive enough that when I moved to a small town where the local store doesn't carry Morning Thunder, I didn't switch back to plain tea.  I had to start getting multiple boxes on my periodic trips to the big city.  I was delighted to find that Amazon now offers it at a price lower than most supermarkets.  Having it delivered (for free with Prime membership or Super Saver) is the ultimate in convenience.<br /><br />I don't find this tea particularly invigorating (not that I notice, anyway, which is perhaps a good thing), but the mate does seem to live up to its reputation as an appetite suppressant.  Whether it revs you up or not, it's a great way to get started in the morning.  And with the astonishingly high level of antioxidants (due both to the tea and the mate), you can actually feel good about drinking it.<br /><br />Don't be alarmed by the six-pack size.  It's a good enough tea that you'll go through it quickly.  Each box is individually wrapped in plastic (as you'd get it at the store), so you can expect a long shelf life."
06	70530,B000FNB3AI,A26DF15P43O6OH,11/5/06,1,2,4,Love these cookies!,I love these cookies!  Talk about getting to eat guilt free.  I gave these cookies four stars because someone used to sugar and processed foods could not appreciate these cookies as much as someone that loves whole foods and the richness that affords.<br /><br />I can't wait to try some of Nana's other cookies!  If you are used to a whole food diet you will give these cookies five stars!!!!
06	84527,B000ES5GMU,A3BO8QRMZM3YUQ,7/23/06,6,6,5,My family loves Ahmad Strawberry Iced Tea,"Here in North Texas we drink iced tea almost every day throughout the year.  I first tried Ahmad Strawberry Tea when it was enclosed with a tea set I purchased for our daughter.  My whole family loved it.  The mango and peach/passion fruit teas are also good, but strawberry ranks as our favorite flavor.  After our local market stopped carrying the Ahmad line, we have been half-heartedly trying other fruit teas, but they don't compare; many of them seem more like Kool-aid with a slight tea flavor.  I look forward to trying other flavors that we weren't able to find in our area."
06	70529,B000FNB3AI,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,11/17/06,1,2,2,"Disappointing compared to Nana's brownie mint, & peanut butter cookies","Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing.  It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors.  (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)<br /><br />Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had:  360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.<br /><br />Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie."

06	71073,B001E77LT6,A2R6RA8FRBS608,12/31/06,2,3,5,Great for people on the run,"Kellogg's Nutri Grain cereal bars make for a tasty snack and they are good for when you need quick energy and you're ""on the go."" They are perfect when you don't have time to eat something more substantial to get quick energy. The price at which Amazon offers them is affordable compared to what my local supermarket charges. These strawberry flavored bars are low in fat and cholesterol, too--a great plus! Moreover, they are even ""certified kosher"" if that matters to you. Moreover, these bars are both chewy and satisfying  SMILE<br /><br />However, this cereal bar is not perfect. Each bar contains 26 grams of carbohydrates and 13 grams of sugar; sugar can sometimes turn into fat in your body. These amounts of carbohydrates and sugar are a lot for a comparatively small cereal bar! Moreover, this food bar is not for anyone on a salt free diet as it contains some salt; and people with allergies to wheat or milk should consult their doctor before they eat this food.<br /><br />These bars go down better if you eat them with juice, milk or water. I eat them with water or apple juice myself.<br /><br />Overall, the strawberry flavored Nutri Grain cereal bars are useful for those of us who are not allergic to any of their ingredients and who want a healthy alternative to a regular breakfast or a candy bar. The Amazon price makes them affordable and I also recommend them as a nutritious snack food that is especially good for people on the run. They are far superior to any candy bar!"
06	84130,B000EVQWHU,A28GRFVAA4DU5P,7/12/06,9,9,5,Cherry flavor with a hint of sour.,"These candies are very good. They have a nice cherry flavor with just a little bit of sour thrown in. Most sour candies made these days make your eyes water and your mouth pucker. Not these gummi's, they have just enough of a sour taste to make them interesting but the sour taste is very very mild.<br /><br />My order came in great condition and very fresh."
06	59375,B000FBM3RC,A16WJEVYQPKAP7,10/15/06,3,4,5,Absolutely perfect!,Once you try this piece of chocolate you will fall in love with it. Probably one of the best nonbar chocolates produced in Switzerland and Europe as a whole. And I think it is rather cheap for the quality you get.

06	33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,11/12/06,19,19,4,Best of the Instant Oatmeals,"McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey."
06	2100,B000EPP56U,A1G6Q2NQMJ2C3X,6/9/06,8,8,5,Excellent rice crackers,"I always disliked soggy or soft crackers with my peanut butter.  And since I also had discovered I was allergic to wheat, I wanted and needed an alternative.  I originally found these Kame Rice Crunch crackers in Kroger supermarkets.  From the first bite, I loved them, and I wished I had discovered them years ago.  The plain variety has just the right amount of salt for taste, and they are perfectly crunchy and light.  I've occasionally had a hard time finding them, so I'm THRILLED that Amazon is now carrying them.  Give these a try, they are delicious!!"

However, also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past.  So, it's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br /> No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers - a wonderful comfort snack.<br /><br /> A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke"

When my doctor told me I had to seriously limit my coffee, (from 3-4 cups a day to 1 or 2 cups per week) I despaired.  How could I have the energy I craved to jumpstart my day without coffee?  I tried various teas and coffee substitutes with limited success.  When I found mate, I knew I was half-way there because I liked the energy, but I longed for stronger taste.  Hence, when I found Morning Thunder, with half mate and half black tea, I rejoiced.  A steaming cup of this, graced with soy milk, is truly a gift from God.  Enjoy!"

You have to put milk and sugar in them to make them really delicious!  I like the Irish Breakfast - very full bodied.  The English breakfast is good but not my favorite when it comes to the Breakfast teas.  I like Republic of Tea's British Breakfast the best.  This is a great sampler package."

06	6304,B000X905WQ,A34SLGWNE8BO85,4/20/06,6,6,5,Head Over Heals for this Treat,"My dog is simply crazy about these treats. But what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well. Since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment. In additon to that, since these treats are all natural, they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats, making them extra healthy.<br /><br />The price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can't beat the quality."

AND that's what this product is.<br /><br />SOME INTERESTING STUFF: WHERE IS THE LARD ON THEIR WEBSITE?<br /><br />Dial, the soap people, own Armour, and Armour makes this Hydrogenated, ""All Natural"" Lard. However, though Armour owns up to making many less than healthy edibles, on their website, there is NO mention of Lard as one of their many products.<br /><br />If you have to use Lard, this is a long established brand that resturants use, and though ""hydrogenated"", this is a good product as hydrogenated Lard goes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I wince when I leave a resturant, and while walking through their parking lot find myself staring at huge tubs of empty lard containers lying around the dumpsters. Funny, but I'd swear they weren't there before I ate.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is not just lard, but Hydrogenated Lard, which should be stricken from the human diet if at all possible. If that is not possible, Armour has been a reliable brand that has been making lard forever, though they don't want to admit it apparently [WONDER WHY?].<br /><br />It does, however, make me wonder what is in Dial soap?!<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"

When I open the package I noticed that the Senseo watermark was very faint and hardly visable.  When I made the coffee, it took me 3X the pods to make a decent cup of coffee.

The spices are well balanced with the tea and one bag is strong enough for an 8 ounce cup.  Just add sweetner and a little cream and voila - Chai Tea Latte with fewer calories than Starbucks!  This is my favorite drink for a cool evening or afternoon pick-me-up.
06	69499,B000EDBQ4M,A2M5HH9CQI59BV,12/20/06,2,2,5,Great and Easy.,I have been experimenting  with gluten free cookie recipes.

Under bake slightly and make sure you let them cool on the sheet then on a rack. I really love them.

06	69650,B003CK7O36,A25XLF8H62HK0P,9/10/06,8,8,5,AWESOME!!,"This tea is amazingly delicious. I have always been a fan of Early Grey tea and didn't think I'd find anything I like more BUT then I drank Stash's DOUBLE Bergamot, which just happens to be the ingredient in Earl Grey that makes it so good, and I've been hooked ever since. I drink alot of tea and this is what I drink....Try it, you'll like it!"
06	69649,B003CK7O36,AVE9KNJYJDESB,10/20/06,9,9,4,"Good, but mostly for Earl Grey fans","I am an Earl Grey fan, and I am currently enjoying a thermos of Stash's Double Bergamot as we speak. The citrus background of the standard Earl Grey mix is definitely amped up, making it into the central focus of the tea (as opposed to the black tea base). It is obvious you are still drinking tea, mind you, but now the bergamot flavoring is a lot more transparently citrus in origin.<br /><br />Cup by cup is probably the best way to make it your first time out. Making it by the traditional ""full pot"" method of ""1 per person and 1 per pot"" (and for me, often ""1 extra just for the fun of it"") makes the taste borderline spicy. This is how I first sampled it and it caused me to cough upon my initial swallow because I knew it was strong but was not quite expecting that level of strength. I recommend a little bit of honey and a little bit of milk to help bring the taste into roundness.<br /><br />Like Lapsang Souchong, this tea has a distinctive flavor that seems perfect for waking you up on a cold morning or refreshing you after a long day's hike. It gives me a little extra perk at work, and I like that.<br /><br />However, I cannot five star this tea because the flavor is a little too intense for the more casual drinker. I like having tea socially, and sharing it with my friends. Most of them outright dislike this one or only sip it sparingly (just like the aforementioned Lapsang Souchong).<br /><br />Earl Grey fans, however, can rest assured that it is a five star review for them."

Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]"

Still, this Traditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea is just spectacular. I've never tasted an herbal tea so good. I'm not sure if I just love the tea or if it truly has ""digestive and nervous system sedating properties"" but I feel relaxed when I drink it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinals' Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea are: organic chamomile flower 1,200 mg., proprietary blend: organic English lavender flower, organic lemon balm leaf . The tea tastes like chamomile with a strong, delicious lavender taste. It is a very fresh taste because there are no flavorings and everything is organic. The smell is yummy, too, even before brewing, as the lavender smell stands out; you could put the tea bags in your drawers to use as sachet fresheners!<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a very responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes on the box: ""The combination of chamomile and lavender with lemon balm has digestive and nervous system sedating properties useful for nervous stomach and restlessness associated with upset stomach. The use of these herbs alone and in combinations for nervous stomach has been approved by European health authorities and is supported by clinical data. Organic Chamomile with Lavender has a pleasantly aromatic and balanced taste."".<br /><br />Also note the following caution from the box: ""Contraindications: Do not use if your have known allergies to plants of the Asteraceae family (daisy) such as blessed thistle, calendula, chamomile, echinacea, safflower or yarrow.""<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

We also tried the raspberry chocolate (still really good) and the raisin chocolate (ok, but couldn't taste any raisin).  I am here to buy more of these and try more flavors.  If you are looking for raw bars, or just some healthy snacks, don't look any further.  One more note, before going raw, I was a chocoholic, I thought for sure that I wouldn't like the one I got that didn't have chocolate, but I love it!!"

The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample."

This is ""Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, Imported from Spain and is stated to be ""All Natural & Cold Pressed"". Bear in mind that ""All Natural"" is not ""Certified Organic"".<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their ""Extra Light"" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the ""Mediterranean"" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of ""mono-saturated fats"" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $3. for 8 ounces. However, it does vary regional and depending on the packaging [bottle or tin] may cost somewhat less by volume. Bear in mind, that Olive will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Smaller containers like this 8 ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the liter or gallon size containers, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is critical.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"

The all-natural raw foods approach makes for the best snack bar I've ever had - delicious, not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner.

The Chocolate Coconut is good, but the coconut flavor isn't as prominent, though it is worth getting.<br />Also if you have seen the Larabar site, they also have Maya Chocolate Bars - I got some, and my first taste was what I can only describe as 'turpentiney' - do not bother.<br />But these Larabars are a great meal replacement, or snack, and oh so healthy -<br />and a great price with Amazon."

Amazon offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type.<br /><br />It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds.  I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.  The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness.  (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.)  My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted.  If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce.<br /><br />*Update*<br />While still not a full-on fan, I enjoying this product more now that:<br /><br />1.  Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y.<br /><br />2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves."

They love the taste and we feel good about the nutritional value, the quality of the food, and the relative ""social conscience"" that the company espouses.<br /><br />By the way: it really is tasty stuff.  I try not to eat a lot of carbs these days, but I always steal a few bites when I make them lunch.  The creamy-cheese sauce is more reminiscent of a good, light alfredo than of the nasty, gluey, neon-orange stuff you get from the big brands, and whole wheat macaroni is mildly flavored (and therefore and easier transition for kids and processed-wheat addicts)."

While it doesn't come close to the homemade kind you get there, it's a GREAT alternative for when you're really craving some or you miss it or you're just far away and can't have it, etc. It's all about adding your personal touch with the ice, maybe some whipped cream and cocoa shavings like they do at the restaurant. So no, it's not the chocolate dessert to end all chocolate desserts, because that's the ORIGINAL frozne hot chocolate, but this is a delicious, inexpensive, fast, substitute and makes a fabulous gift when paired with a mug or other coffee/sweet goodies. So that's the point, it's not to replace the original, it's just to satisfy some cravings, so if you've never had the original it might not be the best thing in the world to you but after you've had the original you'll find these packets will satisfy many, many cravings taht will follow!

The seller blamed it on Amazon putting in the wrong information.  The ad was marked as sold out for a few days.  Yesterday I was checking and the same ad was back on.  When I contacted the seller they again blamed Amazon.  They were again offering a pack of 12 for $[...].  Today they have changed it to a pack of 12 for $[...].  I will be keeping a close eye on them and hope you do too!  An honest seller would have checked their listing and honored their ad. They are saying that Amazon confused thier listing with other sellers of this same product.  They are the only ones selling Lindt Excellence Dark Chocolate 70-Percent Cocoa Bars, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Park of 12).  How could Amazon have gotten this confused! The seller should always check their listing."

The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!"

Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding."

Those prices make me reluctant to use them in most dishes that call for them, and instead I use vanilla bean paste (Williams and Sonoma sells a very good product). But these beans are such a good deal (less than a fifth the supermarket price) that now I'm willing to use them with almost reckless abandon. Vanilla beans really do provide superior flavor to things like rice pudding and custards and vanilla ice cream, a more complex, more luxurious flavor than vanilla extract does. These beans arrived fresh, fragrant, and tightly bagged. They're Madagascar vanilla beans, considered by some cognoscenti to be inferior to Tahitian beans, but not being one of the cognoscenti, I can't detect much difference at all. This product has made me a fan of internet grocery shopping."

I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea- no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.<br /><br />I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time. I love the cover art and the simple goodness of Celestial Seasonings, as it reaches out and transforms many coffee addicts to tea lovers &#61514;<br /><br />- Kasia S."

They may actually buy a Senseo based on trying ours.  They didn't want to drink all of our coffee, but we said go ahead since my husband didn't like it.  They must have had 3 cups each of this coffee, it was like they couldn't get enough.  I suggest that you actually try any Senseo flavor by buying one pack at the store first to see if you like the flavor.  If you do, come back to Amazon and order in bulk to save you money.  $3.84 at Walmart for a package of 10 pods = .38 each.  Here it is only .25 a cup of coffee at the current price."

I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.

After learning my lesson the hard way, I use it VERY sparingly as a condiment. When I first brought this bottle of thermo-nuclear liquid home, I decided to make a super-charged Buffalo Wing sauce. I proceeded to mix about a tablespoon of this in with some Frank's Red Hot (about 2 or 3 ounces)into which I dumped a dozen or so chicken wings hot out of the oil.  As I began eating the first wing, the sensation of heat was pretty intense. I was reasonably sure I had committed an error in judgement; after eating about 1/2 a dozen wings (and downing a couple of beers) I lost the ablity to see, speak or think clearly. Seriously, This is a great flavorful sauce with tons of heat.  Enjoy responsibly. Oh, and as others have mentioned, the ""secondary"" burn of this sauce is not to be underestimated."

They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."

It is herbal tea (caffeine-free) containing solely dried lime---that's all---not lime and green/black tea, not artificial lime flavor, but real lime---alone---a truly remarkable feat. It is certified organic, and is kosher. It has the most amazing tart and lovely taste.  If you like lime, you'll love this tea.  If you don't like lime, definitely pass, as it is a very intense ""lime experience"".  I love it!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer lyrically writes: ""From the far reaches of the Arabian Desert, this rare lime has been enjoyed for thousands of years, both as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and as a teasan. Traditionally harvested and dried in the hot desert sun, this oasis of Vitamin C has been drunk to soothe just about everything. The first taste brings a distant yet familiar impression, leaving the trace of a fleeting memory on the tip of your tongue. We find that its clean, bracing, and reviving citrus pleasure, nicely balanced with a touch of sugar, lifts the blues. Try it, you'll fall in love with it!""<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and enjoy lime, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love lime, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. In fact, I have never heard of anyone else making this tea.  I enjoy serving it to company, but even more, just for me.<br /><br />*****"

You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- ""Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss"" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br />- ""The ABS Diet"", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br />- ""Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot"", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life."

If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do.  The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains.  The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.<br /><br />Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting.  Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives.  All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources."

Imagine a thick green apple gumminese intense in flavor floating on top of a soft white pillow of mashmallow.  Glad that you can get it next day for $3.99 more don't you?

Its name derives from the quichua word ""mati"" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served. On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea. Knowing its manifold health benefits -- among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals -- the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land. In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well. In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts."

It is extremely poor.  The chocolate was chalky, not at all smooth.  The flavor was absolutely horrendous!!  A expected a hint of ginger and chai.  The bar was so overpowered by the ""hint"" of flavors that it completely washed out any of the chocolate flavor.  I was so surprised by the nastiness of the bar.  (I refuse to call it chocolate), that I spit it out.  Then I threw out this $2.75 bar of yuck."

You can add it to ice cream you are freezing (or gelato or sorbet) or you can add it to chocolate icing to make mocha flavor. It is the ingredient to have when the recipe calls for ""one cup of strong, cold coffee.""<br /><br />As a beverage on its own, it is a bit more acid than fresh espresso.

You won't make a barrista cup of espresso with instant, but you will have a great way to make a latte in a pinch and for regular cooking, I personally am never without this jar on my shelf."

In fact, I'm drinking a mug of it right now as I right this review! I LOVE IT!!  However, I make it in more of a latte fashion.  I've also added hot chocolate to it for a mocha latte.

But if you realize how good for you they are and that they are made with real, natural ingredients then hopefully they will satisfy.  My husband says they are a little smelley, but I think it is because they are made with real cheddar not the imitation stuff in other cheese crackers.  Nicely salted and very yummy.

When the packet arrived, I tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth, expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity.  Instead, I got a mouthful of hard shells.  I crunched through the tough, outer hulls, wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard, unopened shells, but then as I macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash, found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing.<br /><br />When my wife came home, I mentioned to her how I was ripped off by the Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and, in fact, were barely edible.  My wife picked up the empty packet, looked at it for a moment, and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair.  ""You idiot,"" she said, ""these seeds are for planting.""  She then clobbered me with an antique, oak coat tree.  ""I don't know why I ever married you,"" she continued, ""you are always doing stupid, embarrassing things, and no matter how hard I hit you, you never learn.""  She then whacked me with the coffee table for emphasis.<br /><br />Maybe I had gotten a bad batch of seeds.

Whattya want for 11-25 cents?<br /><br />I think they're very handy & filling when a hurry or on a diet, for the price.<br /><br />I've add cheese, powdered cheese, a little tomato sauces, or powdered garlic & onion to these to make them taste extra super.

I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender.

I was also happy at how satisfied I felt after finishing a bowl; it was filling and nutritious and gave me plenty of energy to get through the morning.  It's gently sweet without tasting ""sugary"", and I like the crunchy texture.  Kashi GOLEAN Crunch is also available (and tasty!) if you like your breakfast EXTRA crunchy."

06	64846,B000EMM96W,A3RO3CGZ9MWA1I,10/30/06,6,7,4,Simple muffins that anyone can easily make,"What I like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total.  Many other mixes make 12 or more, and, if you have a small household, you're stuck with way too many muffins.<br /><br />These were better than expected - they are soft, flavorful, and baked perfectly.  Also, use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking.<br /><br />It isn't the healthiest food out there, but overall, I'd recommend this mix."

You will either love it or hate it.  The tea leaves are allowed to decompose or compost a bit.... it is weird but it makes a amazingly powerful tea.  It is supposed to promote weight loss if you want to use it for that reason.

There are lots of nuts and different kinds of fruit, but there is a bit too much sweetener (honey, etc).

When my wife tasted a sample, she immediately said ""I could eat this every day."" Which is why I bought it. As for myself, I think it's a bit bland, but I have a sweet tooth."

You name it, if you can put some flaxseed in it, she's done it.  I tell you, since the flaxseed revolution, I have been more regular than at any point in my life.  I'm telling you, you can set your clock by my regularity.  In fact, the flaxseed muffins have my drive to work a perilous activity as I have limited time before the flaxseed does its magic. Flaxseed meal is rich in fiber, lignans and omega-3 fats.  You can't go wrong there...try some flaxseed, this stuff is magic."

06	49515,B001E5E268,A196SEEGLL4OGD,9/4/06,10,10,3,"Good, but not great","Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding."

I use them as side dishes and in casseroles and find they add zing to every meal.  I brought a casserole with this blend to a potluck supper and every single grain and berry was gone at the end.  It was a big hit.  If you want to try something different from regular brown or white rice, give RiceSelect Royal Blend a whirl.  I'm betting you enjoy every morsel."

They don't fill the bag with dust and fannings. There really are recognizably sized leaves in this bag.<br /><br />2. You can tell that the leaves are decent sized because the almost-clear nylon bag gives you a great view into them.<br /><br />3. They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1/3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.<br /><br />Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black / white / green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach. I love it.<br /><br />Also, the Sweet Ginger Peach tea makes excellent iced tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."

A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!"

When I say EXTREME, I mean cramping so bad that I would have minor blackouts. My mother-in-law suggested I take some organic virgin coconut oil and I took a tablespoon of it, however it didn't taste good at all. It did make my cramps go away for that entire day. So my wonderful husband went out and bought me some of these capsules from the health food store, I was kind of skeptical b/c he paid $20 for it, but I thanked him and started popping the suggested amount, 3 caps, 3 times a day.<br /><br />Since the caps have a small amount in each cap, you have to take that many to get it in your system. The first month I took them, the cramps subsided to just enduring slight pain in the morning on my first day. The second month I didn't experience any PMS symptoms and even less pain on the first day. The third month I experienced NO PMS and NO PAIN through my whole 7 days. I've heard it is good for lowering your cholesterol and help maintain weight amongst other things. I'm just happy they made my cramps go away."

Bought two bottles last time to see the effect of age and were pleased to find that it matures exceptionally well - the taste becomes increasingly mellow and buttery but retains the taste of olives. Wonderful drizzled over antipasti, or simply with crusty bread (and a glass of red (hem, hem).

The calories from this product are from good sources and that is what counts.  Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.  I'd give these delicious bars a try and fit them into your food management routine any way you see fit!  It definitely goes in the good food category for sure.  Don't hate the fat, hate the lack of discipline and they are a tempting yummy. :)"

We used to use a couple of other brands, but this is all we buy now.  Even the non-celiacs in our family love it."

I wanted to try whole wheat to be healthier, but it's really not worth it. It has a different texture that I didn't like. The flavor was okay but a little bland. If you want a good mac and cheese, stick with the original version from Annie's!"

I tried the ""energy"" bars and ""nutrition"" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw these in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I have now tried most of the Larabar flavours, and these are my favourite - very simple 2-ingredients, but they go great together.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar."

It is so much better than the stuff from the grocery store, and even most fancy coffee places. Additionally, the price is good and the shipping is fast."

Our newest dog was an itcher and after research, I decided to try a new dog food.  I settled on Canidae for the same reason as the other reviewers; top notch ingredients at a reasonable price.<br /><br />She loves it.  I alternate dry with dry/wet every other day.  And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots.  Vet believes that she was allergic to corn products in Iams; a common allergy for dogs.<br /><br />And the added benefits are about the poop; less poop to pick up, poop is solid, not runny, and like the other reviewer said, the poop is way less smelly."

Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink."
06	82523,B000FL52IY,ARMGD218MFU0S,11/4/06,7,7,5,Savory and Smooth,I like a good cup of Joe and when our friends turned us on to Kona coffee we were instant fans.  But the cost was killing us.  So when I saw that Amazon had their new grocery line I was on it checking out their price.  This is a great cup of Kona for the price.  I hate bitter coffee - this is smooth.

Real ginger makes it spicy and crunchy and everything else makes it sweet, and the whole shebang is just so good for you. They vanquish hunger for hours and give you lots of energy.

This is not the same as the No Sugar version of the Original Formula with the muesli consistency that expands when soaked with milk or soymilk and which has the wonderful date pulp flavoring.  This is a new hybrid muesli-flakes version that I have never seen for sale in stores especially created for American taste which is used to lots of flakes and raisins.  Now I have to finish off six boxes before I can go back to Original Formula or No Sugar Original Formula."
06	36111,B000FBQ594,A2SYO0E2LDZ7YN,9/17/06,17,18,5,Pretty Darn Good!,"The cookie part of these isn't sweet;  tastes just like an animal cracker.  The filling tastes just like Nutella,  I think it's a great flavor combination.  There are 25 packs of a dozen cookies each in the box.  Some nutritional info from the label:  serving size- 2 cookies,  calories-140,  trans fat-0,  saturated fat- 6g.<br /><br />OK, OK,  so these are not the most nutritious snack,  but come on!  They're cookies!  An occasional indulgence isn't going to hurt anyone.<br /><br />If you think you'll like the taste combination of animal crackers and Nutella,  then buy these.  If you are worried about saturated fat,  buy some fruit instead."

Try experimenting<br /><br />by mixing it up a bit with other favorite cereals,<br /><br />or some nuts / seeds.<br /><br />I am hoping that Amazon will start to sell this same brand,<br /><br />except that the honey is replaced by a FRUIT JUICE sweetner.<br /><br />A positive alternative for those who avoid honey."

The Hot Short Shots are the perfect treat with a zing anytime you need a quick snack. I love the 2.1 lbs package. I can keep plenty of beef sticks on hand for when the gang drops in to watch the game. Everyone loves the delicious beef taste of Short Shots and the hot ones are perfect with the cool beverages. Our friends would call it a foul if there was football without Hot Short Shots!

They are a healthy alternative to other artificial junk foods. This is a great price too. It's normally $2.99 per box at the local market. Whole wheat pasta shells with white cheddar cheese is delicious!

We all love it!"
06	22596,B000CQ25QE,A26HFSVLAGULIM,11/20/06,1,2,5,THIS STUFF TASTES GREAT & IT'S CERTIFIED ORGANIC TOO !!!!!,"IN A NUTSHELL: THIS REALLY MADE ME INTO A BELIEVER IN 'CERTIFIED ORGANIC' PRODUCTS<br /><br />Everything that one could want in a boxed 'Macaroni & Cheese' meal is in this excellent product from 'Annie's Homegrown'. Its ingredients are 'Certified Organic', with real cheese and whole wheat pasta. The rusult is a very healthy fast-food that tastes significantly better, creamier, richer and more satisfying than its processed counterpart and WITHOUT COSTING THAT MUCH MORE!<br /><br />I had never heard of this product until I received a sample of it in the mail several months ago. Now, I exclusively consume only this 'Annie's' brand Mac & Cheese, and essentially refuse the other major brands which do contain artificial ingredients. I have tried many of the different varieties that Annie's offers and have been universally satisfied thusfar.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY BUT I DO BUY AND EAT THIS STUFF]"

Pamela's Amazing bread is not only moist, it is light and fluffy.  I am a wheat eater, and I love this bread.  By far the beast gluten free bread (mix) I have ever tried."

06	78330,B00064VQO4,A34QNQ9DVRYN5Y,11/19/06,13,14,4,A remakably mixed review,"This olive oil adds a freshness to every dish that you're bound to notice.  It's true what the others are saying, this oil is different than most others.  When I first got tasted it strait, was shocked at the resemblence to wheat grass juice and the bitterness that lingers in the back of your throat.  Compared to my regular store bought EVOO's heaviness and richness, this one is clean and bright.  But my first reaction was to write the seller and find out if my bottle tasted as it should or if I'd gotten a bad bottle.  They wrote back saying that the grassy flavor and ""peppery notes"" (bitterness, in my book) comes from the relatively young olives.  I was also impressed by the fact that I got this in Sept and it was bottled as recently as August, probably also responsible for the fresh taste.  Getting this olive oil inspired me to try some other brands and I have found a very similar taste without the bitterness in the slightly less exensive Trader Joe's Australian variety of EVOO.  Both are great when used in fresh dishes and shine best when they aren't cooked.  My biggest question is, why aren't people reviewing more EVOO products on Amazon.  The fact that this one is the only one who's following sings it's praises here should tell you that it's worth trying."
06	84141,B000EVQWHU,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,11/7/06,1,1,5,Ya gotta love sours to love these,These cherries are sour and chewy. Just writing about them makes my mouth water as if I were thinking of sucking on a lemon. You have to like sour things to enjoy these. But they are pretty nice if you do love sour flavors.
06	30011,B000DZFMEQ,A31ZP8WD3UYD4H,6/3/06,2,3,5,Best Gluten-Free Bread Mix ever!!,I love Pamela's Products wheat free bread. It has the closest taste to real bread. I also use her baking mix as a substitute for flour in several of my old recipes. My family can't tell if it's wheat flour or gluten free. Love it!!!

The Everlasting Treat Toy (one for each with both side holding a treat) have lasted the kids for going on a week now.  They love the taste, their teeth look great, and they continue to play with it right up until they get the last bit of treat out.  When the package says your dog will be busy for hours, they aren't lying.  I'm sold on this product and am busy stocking up on refills to keep my goldens happy."

06	42020,B000F0JNHG,AOA1AJJZSDS01,12/18/06,6,6,3,Effective yet not a good value,"Buy the 2.2-lb. container; you will get much more per dollar.  As noted in the product description, ""One 1.25 pound container will cover approximately 50 square feet.""  That's basically a 7-foot square.<br /><br />The ingredients do seem to be effective, based on the use of one 1.25-pound container, which kept my neighbor's dog out of a small area for about two days.  This product is an alternative to the several dog repellents, such as Hartz ""Stay Off"", that use methyl nonyl ketone.  It works about as well but, ounce for ounce, it is much more expensive."

All I can say is that if you are reading this, you MUST try it!!!<br /><br />It is GREEN & tastes like OLIVES! It is raw, cold pressed-it is the absolute highest quality & the BEST TASTING  OLIVE OIL EVER!!! No, I have no connection to the company! :) I originally purchased this oil from Eat Raw a few years ago & have been singing it's praise ever since! I honestly cannot eat another olive oil. I have when I have had no choice & it's just so noticable-anyone near me at the time will be hearing a dissertation on the complete and total superiority of Bariani! One taste & you will never want another olive oil! It's THAT good!!! I just had to tell someone... :) :) :)"

No wonder these are called Raw Revolution... they taste revolting!!<br /><br />It seriously blows my mind that someone could make a food with chocolate and coconut that tastes so awful.  The first taste is poor, at best.  The mouth feel is grainy.  And the aftertaste... wow thats nasty.<br /><br />I ordered these b\c they were on sale and I wanted to try organic raw food.  Good thing that was a cheap lesson.  Learn from my mistake.  DONT BUY THIS!"

I wanted one that would be both good for cooking and taste great on it's own.  After much research (and buying in local supermarkets) I came upon Bariani's web site.  I have been ordering this olive oil now for four years and it is a staple in my home.  I couldn't imagine cooking without it."

However my husband called them Healthy Brownies.  He said he could taste the flax seed.  I tend to agree.  In my opinion, if I'm going to eat chocolate, I don't want it to have that ""healthy"" taste.  On the other hand I love the Blueberry Muffins that Hodgson Mill makes."

I ordered these truffles and recieved them securely packaged and protected to ensure they arrived safely and as quickly as possible.  I am even planning a special dinner with friends entirely based around the truffles I ordered as I was so please with them.<br /><br />  I also saw the other products this company carries - the attention to detail and the information provided on each and every product is outstanding - just like their quality (i.e.: Saffron).  I have found my gourmet source from now on!

06	35455,B000E7YPPK,A1IDTESNPA9Q9I,10/27/06,9,10,5,Tasty Thai Meal To Have In Your Pantry,"My favorite Thai dish to order out is Pad Thai.  When I get a craving, but can't get to a restaurant I will make Taste of Thai Pad Thai for Two.  Usually I do share it with a family member, but if not, the leftovers make a tasty lunch.  The flavor of the sauce is very authentic.  Not too heavy or light-just right.  The amount of rice noodles is substantial.  The package makes a good size meal for two.  I add my own chicken pieces or shrimp along with some green onions, and if I have some broccoli, I'll throw that in as well.  This is a great item to keep in your pantry for when you want something different and exotically tasty."
06	54375,B0009JRKDC,ACF0C7ROQGC9T,7/4/06,54,56,5,not only for cooking,I use this coconut oil as a skin softener.  It is fabulously rich and it smells good too.  I also use it on my hair when doing a heat treatment.  It strengthens the hair shaft and makes hair healthy and resists split ends.

A creamy center that can easily be eaten separatly by nibbling off the cookie top and bottom.  A dry cookie that isn't too sweet but full of flavor.<br /><br />Great for a mid-day snack.  I always have a roll in my desk draw at work.<br /><br />Very Very Tasty!

(California).  People (including, in the past, myself)don't actually understand that even the olive oils imported from Italy now are sub-standard.  Bariani, by contrast, is the nearest to what was consumed by the Greeks and Romans of long ago:  simply cold-pressed in small batches, no heat is used, no other oils are used, no other additives are used.<br /><br />I'm not a gourmet, instead I am a fat 51-year-old that tends to veer towards the boxed hamburger meals when desperate!  This is not ""snooty gourmets"" liking their incidental odd-tasting items, Bariani Olive Oil is truly and simply a great product and I agree with all the other reviewers: EXCELLENT.<br /><br />By the way, I do know the first clue that you are not buying a true olive oil is when the container is clear:  true olive oil cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. Bariani uses a proper, imported, dark-green bottle for their very special product.<br /><br />Even Olive Oil can get complicated:  the majority of olive oils, imported and domestic, are heated, not 100% olive oil and taste terrible after tasting Bariani.<br /><br />I also buy through the company website and by phone and these people are so kind and upstanding -- it's family owned and they intend to keep it that way.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the day will come when Bariani may have to increase their prices due to the law of supply and demand...and I would still buy it!<br /><br />YES IT IS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE IS SAYING IN THEIR REVIEWS."

They wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied. I ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered. I called JR and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence FOR FREE!!!!!!!!! Name another seller that would do that.

Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it once we started inserting some of the paste into the Kong cavity.  All of them go nuts when we put down the ""pasty Kongs"" for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!<br /><br />I would highly recommend all of Kongs' ""tasty pastes"" - it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make a mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs.

It was so hard and chewy that it hurt my jaw.  The taste was ok, not as chocolatey as I had hoped.  The caramel was good but pretty sticky, and it got on my fingers.  The nuts and things on the outside were pretty good, but kept falling off and onto the floor.  I guess I'll try for a less messy kashi bar next time."

Plus they live longer, more fulfilling lives. So who cares about hydrogenated oils (as in palm kernel and coconut)? Seriously, people. Go outside for a change and get off your computer, get some exercise, and stop being stressed out over the little things in life, such as banning so-called ""deadly"" oils. Some oils make things taste better, as the case with these fine cookies  :)"

I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price."

Many commercial gums that are advertised as containing xylitol also contain unnatural, chemical sweeteners. The flavor and soft texture lasts very well in the peppermint and fruit flavors. Another family member really enjoys the licorice one. The chocolate has a disappointing flavor, and the cinnamon, which to me tastes like almond at first, quickly gets hard and loses flavor. Haven't tried spearmint. While the serving size is listed as 2 pieces, I find 1 is exactly the right amount for my mouth."

I love Dr. McDougall's oatmeal because it's organic, it has much less sugar but it's still very flavorful, it has lots of real fruit pieces, and it has nutritious grains. A great filling food that I can trust to be healthy! Great fuel!"

They press it from fresh coconuts, and I think that's what gives it the nice gentle fragrance and wonderful taste. I like the clear plastic jar it comes in. We've been using coconut oil for years and Nutiva tastes much better than the coconut oil from dried coconuts. I even spread it on crackers. Yummy!"

Not only that, it helps with digestion as well if you have any digestive troubles and is great when doing pungent therapy.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic peppermint leaf 840 mg, bitter fennel fruit 210 mg, organic ginger rhizome 210 mg Proprietary blend: organic rose hip, papaya leaf, organic alfalfa leaf, organic cinnamon bark."

I also use when I'm baking istead of using other types of oil or shortening.<br /><br />Extra Virgin Coconut oil is the best. I made the mistake of getting the refined coconut oil once(different brand), and there is huge difference in the taste. The refined oil has no coconut taste, it tastes like shortening."
06	36113,B000FBQ594,A3Q4TYJVAM4IRM,10/4/06,29,36,4,Tasty but high-fat,"These cookies are very tasty, surprisingly crisp and light, and don't taste at all like comparable inexpensive packaged cookies from the US. They are made in Poland for a German company and taste a lot like many confections from Europe, where crisp wafers and balanced tasting fillings are the norm(rather than the over-sweet cream fillings common here in the US)<br /><br />Contrary to another review here, the ingredients/nutrients list states that are are 0g of trans-fats in theese cookies.  However, there's a LOT of saturated fat.  That's a concern because if you're a normal healthy adult, you could easily eat a package of these in one sitting (only 5 ounces!)...in which case you would have had about your week's worth of saturated fat in one sitting!  Since our country has a massive (literally) weight problem, that's something to be aware of.<br /><br />Hard to beat the taste for the price, but eat with care."

In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them."

They are wonderful cookies and at less than $1 a pack you cannot go wrong. These things were made for a quick coffee or milk dunk. Don't let them soak as the light cookie will fall apart, but a quick dip sets them up just fine!  They come well packed and wrapped. Recommended highly!"

06	44187,B0007NOWMM,AEJJH9OG0QMCQ,1/23/06,0,0,4,Highly enjoyable,"I prefer flavored coffees and this one has been quite good.  The flavor is just enough - not too oppressive and not too mild.  I have also tried the Vienna and Kilarny and have enjoyed those too.  In comparison to the Maxwell House Hazelnut, these are superior.  The Maxwell House Hazelnut was almost devoid of flavor and quite weak, even though it was well before its expiry date and I had just opened the package.  I like this well enough to make sure I keep it stocked in my kitchen."

06	29133,B000FFVYFA,ADA27F279TGTM,11/2/06,4,4,5,Healthy food can taste good.,"I like these bars because they are all natural and I feel like I'm getting a snack while still eating healthy.  The sugar grams are a little high, but at least they're coming from natural sources (honey, glucose) and not refined sugars.  They're not TOO sweet... they just taste very natural - like you dipped mixed, raw nuts into honey and ate it.  They're very crunchy and satisfy hunger cravings very well.  I love to get these at Borders bookstore as a nice healthy snack option while I'm out shopping.  I looked here to try some of the other flavors, but I'm hesitant to stray from the Nut Delight because it seems the other Kind bars have more saturated fat and more grams of sugar.  The Nut Delight seems like the best option of the bunch."

06	6248,B000E65OF6,A26A64X86VL1R4,3/16/06,2,2,5,The classic!,"Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation."" Oscar Wilde."

The only problem we encountered is that it was poorly packed for shipping and as fragile as the product was, we had many soft globs of chocolate surrounded by wafer flakes. There was at least 75% breakage.<br /><br />We will try it again soon, but if it comes damaged, it will be return/refund time."

I was so sad when they were hard to find in the U.S. for a few years... but VERY excited when I saw them for sale at a grocery store a week ago!!!  As for it being ""bad"" for you - honestly, you don't need to eat a whole bag!  I have two and am content.  There is no point being greedy - you're only hurting yourself.<br />I think they taste better than Gnutella, and MUCH better than Hersheys  crunchy wafers.  These have a unique and fluffy taste, and whenever I am eating them, I am reminded of patisseries found overseas.  They are especially tasty out of the fridge and without filling melting on your hands.<br /><br />*Update January 25, 2008:<br />I finally bought the 25 package deal and they took a week to get to my front door (but it came along with the newly released HP#5 ).  I used to munch on these as a little kid and then they went MIA for about a decade.  The chocolate has a slightly different taste than what my taste buds are used to now but that's because they're not American, they're German cookies... obviously they're a bit different!!  And as for nutritious value... come on now, they are cookies not fruit.  All in all, I am very happy with them and will probably buy them again - you can't beat the $.40/packet price!"

06	68702,B000EH4XZC,AYFNND2XCUXF1,12/12/06,7,8,5,Perfect Risotto--Every Time!,"Sure, you've got to have some patience if making even a simple risotto with little ingredients, but it's the cooking time, the prep and then stirring, for about thirty minutes or so, that makes this so. If you're a rice lover though, and you've never tried making this creamy dish, you must give it a try! Not only is it easy to make, but it's one of those dishes that you can put on the table, roll out the impressive name it comes with (I just love the way risotto sounds when spoken) and you've got an impressive and tasty presentation for guests or even your family.<br /><br />It can be as simple as the great recipe on the box, which Amazon lists in the label description above, or you can fancy it up with some great grilled chicken or shrimp and crispy (or steamed if you prefer) veggies. I would recommend using a good wine, one you'd likely drink with your meal, since this only adds to the amazing flavor (cooking wines DO NOT do the trick!). Experiment with the recipe on the package if you want. Parmasan cheese is a great additive at the very end, it's rich pungent smell coalescing with the other flavors excellently, but don't be afraid to try some others,. i.e. fontina, asiago--heck, even some cheddars work great! When those short grains start to release their starches, the creaminess comes into play and you're almost ready to eat! The smells are devine and it's a dish you will not be able to resist. RiceSelect's risotto rice works great every time, making for the perfect risotto experience."

Given the chunky consistency and the fact that it has the word ""colon"" in the name is pretty much a turn off. It appears to be more the result of a colon cleansing if you ask me. In any case it has an odd and slightly bitter taste. I think it's the mustard they put in it. Yuck..."

I actually got the recipe out of my Lipton soup mix cookbook and it's as follows:<br /><br />Country Herb Roasted Chicken<br /><br />1 chicken (2 1/2 to 3 lb.), cut into serving pieces (with or without skin) or 1 1/2 lb. boneless skinless chicken breast halves<br /><br />1 envelope Lipton Recipe Secrets Savory Herb with Garlic or Golden Herb with Lemon Soup Mix<br /><br />2 TBS water<br /><br />1 TBS olive or vegetable oil<br /><br />Preheat oven to 375 degrees.<br /><br />In a 13x9 baking or roasting pan, arrange chicken.  In a small bowl, combine remaining ingredients; brush on chicken.<br /><br />For chicken pieces, bake uncovered 45 minutes or until chicken is done.  For chicken breast halves, bake uncovered 20 minutes or until chicken is done.<br /><br />Makes about 4 servings.<br /><br />I do hope you'll try it.

But he don't need anything fancy, that's for sure. I just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that. He's not one of them cat's that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline. I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to ""Fighter Feast"" or ""Beastly Feast"". So, I'm giving this product 3 stars: five stars because it's a pretty great feast, minus three stars because the name offends Tubby Toughie, and plus one star because I like to lick the can."

I ordered (2) bags so I qualified for FREE SHIPPING even! My order of favorite are as follows; the CLEAR - PINEAPPLE!! MMMM!! GREEN - STRAWBERRY, RED - RASPBERRY, ORANGE - ORANGE and YELLOW - LEMON. I wish I could just buy by the flavor but that is not an option, even on their website. =-("
06	76921,B0001AU3OW,A364NH8SBM17HD,2/3/06,6,7,5,"Excellent Teas, and the best Tea Pot Ever",I have quickly become a fan of this tea company.  I have never seen a loose leaf tea brewer that works as well!!  I really is wonderful.  The teas in this collection all taste wonderful.  I recommend this as the perfect gift for the tea afficianado in your life.
06	2707,B003NDA970,A1KHOI0WVQRI2J,6/28/06,20,20,5,Great Popcorn,"I won't claim to be a professional food taster ... I just know what I like and don't like.  I don't like ""yellow"" popcorn, I don't like microwave popcorn, I like the ""white"" popcorn cooked in a pan.  For my ""popping style"" the Baby White pops great w/o lots of hard kernels.  'nuf said."
06	61818,B000BLNU6E,A2CS2R3ZJCILMF,10/25/06,23,25,5,Very good gift,"I have sent this basket a number of times to family and friends.  I always receive wonderful responses, and have often shared these wonderful chocolates."
06	73421,B000EPOC28,A3OO6053SN6M5P,8/4/06,1,3,1,Stale out of the box,"These don't taste like the regular Honey Grahams.  I am not sure if I got a defective item, but I couldn't stomache these.  It tasted stale and off."
06	36116,B000FBQ594,A1SYLII0808HD6,12/26/06,14,17,5,"Delicious Treat--Hey, It's Not a Diet Food!","There's little question that these cookies have the crumbly pastry-like taste associated with European biscuits in general, they're flaky good like a buttery crust, although not quite as rich and moist as Vienna's finest. The insides is moister; howver, replete with creamy soft chocolate flvor, almost pudding-like in consistency. However, your Honor, since there's a nutritional debate among these reviews, I'd like to enter into evidence the incontrovertible the facts right off this 5.3 ounce package OF ""HITs"" that I hold in my hand.<br /><br /> Exhibit A.<br /><br />The following shows the amount and percent of the recommended daily allowance (rda) of one serving - that's two HIT cookies, or 27 grams--based on a 2,000 calorie/day diet.In one serving (two cookies (27 grams):<br /><br />Calories per serving: 140, total fat =7 grams (11%), Saturated fat=6 grams (29%), Cholesterol, 0 grams; sodium, 75 mg (3%); and 17 grams (6%) of carbohydrates, including 1 gram (3%) of  dietary fiber and 9 grams of sugar--and two grams of protein. You also get 2%  of the RDA of Calcium, and 4% of iron.<br /><br />Exhibit B:<br /><br />Compare this to ""one serving"" or two (28 grams) cookies of wheat-free/dairy free, mostly organic Newman O's (a somewhat healthier version of the classic OREO): Total fat (4.5 grams), Saturated fat (1.5 g). Trans fat (0 g), calories (130), sugar (10.0 grams), Total Carbohydrates, (31.5g), dietary fiber (1 g), protein (2 g), sodium (85 mg), no cholesterol, iron (8%).<br /><br />Nutritional conclusion (As always, consult  your physician!):<br /><br />Newman's beats the pants off HIT  in total fat, saturated fat (HIT has 4 times as much), twice as much of the RDA of iron but has over twice as many carbohydrates, and minimally more sugar and sodium.<br /><br />Style points:<br /><br />I can see Audrey Hepburn eating a HIT bar (without the bright wrapper) or something like it, served on a silver platter, with Italian coffee or perhaps some tea.  I cannot see her, unless she's slumming it in ""Roman Holiday"" eating an Oreo, even one owned by an actor as great as Paul Newman. HIT cookies--loved by kids, suitable for the adult.<br /><br /> Offered here at a great price; moveover, Amazon.com ships this free on eligible orders of $25 or more."

06	71052,B000F4D5JE,AKXCQP3DLGW7F,7/6/06,7,7,3,Acceptable,"My kids thought they tasted awful. (Which is strange, as they love gummy vitamins.) They are quite pricey & have a strange consistancy. *I* liked them (the taste)... my kids couldn't get past the ""feel""... If you've tried Gerber's graduates Fruit snacks.. these taste very similar... Great alternative for those on the GFCF diet... I wouldn't buy them again..."
06	62758,B000I1OLT2,A1TCOAJUQ4Q72R,11/2/06,4,4,5,Quality & Flavor,This tea is made with quality ingredients and has a wonderful mint flavor that is not too strong.  It makes a great iced tea!
06	60835,B001E5E05G,A1247WRBA4ZC9H,9/22/06,1,2,5,Treat yourself with a great breakfast.,"I was attracted to this cereal because of high fiber and protine content. I ate this cereals everyday for two weeks and noticed a significant difference in my health. I am hooked onto this cereals, especially because of great test and high fiber content. This is a much better option than trying to eat green stock vegetables or worse metamucil. :)"
06	73420,B000EPOC28,A16U19D4893B70,10/14/06,2,4,1,Try another brand,"Sorry, but the first reviewer was right.  I have tried this brand a couple of times hoping I had just bought a bad box the first time.  The taste is like cardboard and the textture is grainy.  I eat all natural foods and this one is not up to my standards.  Try Back to Nature brand or Annie's Home Grown.  My kids prefer Annie's Bunnies but I like the Back to Nature sticks."

06	56962,B0007W4VXI,A9NS1NAUUNG7X,5/23/06,7,8,5,Espresso-lover's Dream,I've looked all over for a decent selection of espresso pods. I was so<br /><br />happy to find PodMerchant's Super Sampler. There are two each of 29<br /><br />different pods so I was able to try out more different pods than I'd be<br /><br />able to otherwise. This is an espresso-lover's dream! I'm also going to<br /><br />try PodMerchant's Decaf Sampler.
06	12033,B0004M0GJ4,A3BH49ZKESHDID,1/5/06,1,1,5,Good diet cereal,"This is a good high fiber breakfast cereal with a high protein content.  It does contain some sodium, but has a good potassium/sodium ratio.  It has some sugar content (evaporated cane juice) and a good flavor.  It generally is found in health food sections of larger supermarkets or in health food stores, and is now available on the Internet.  My main complaint is that retailers do not generally carry the hot cereal equivalent (which I managed to get my friend Lisa to carry in her health food store)."

He thought it was silly, but not after he started eatting them.  He would not share this huge bag of bears.  lol  They were good, the ones I could get away from him, fresh and not stuck together.  Good stuff!"
06	25264,B000CQ01LA,A25PM9JGHPU8EI,8/19/06,6,6,5,Heaven in your mouth,"Oh my god these shells and white cheddar cheese are glorious. You really should buy CASES of these, they are so delicious. If you have a hearty appetite, this ""family size"" will serve one just fine. I can't get over how amazing it tastes. Not only that, but for this recipe the shells are perfect - they hold the flavor MAGNIFICENTLY! It only takes minutes to prepare. And be ready: you may begin shedding tears of joy once you place a spoonful in your mouth - it is THAT good. Plus it's organic if that's important to you."
06	36859,B000E1HUXK,ACEACOFMCC11O,5/12/06,11,11,5,Wonderful product!,"I was looking to supplement my breastmilk, but was having a horrible time finding something that worked.  I tried at least 8 different formula's  including the new Alimentum, but this was the only formula that my son could tolerate physically and still tasted good to him.  You can buy this formula for cheaper at Walmart for $23/can."
06	64010,B000NHYNNU,A26A64X86VL1R4,9/28/06,0,0,5,"Tasty, soothing and actually helps enhance immunity!","Traditional Medicinals Echinacea Plus is an herbal remedy in tea form designed to support the immune system.  Echinacea is a Native American herb and is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines in the US and Europe.  This tea delivers the immune boosting properties of organic Echinacea in a pleasant tasting blend of organic West Indian lemongrass leaf and organic spearmint.  Echinacea Plus has a serene and subtle lemon-mint flavor that is exceptionally comforting for colds, and soothing to scratchy raw throats.  Echinacea provides a slight tingle on the tongue due to the presence of alkylamides.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals recommends drinking 5-6 cups a days as soon as symptoms appear and then gradually reducing the dosage as symptoms improve.<br /><br />Numerous clinical studies have examined the effects of Echinacea.  Echinacea stimulates activity of cells that fight infection in our bodies and increases the number of these cells such as the white blood cells and lymphocytes. These immune cells attack bacteria, viruses and abnormal cells, including cancer.  Echinacea has a positive effect on wound  healing, lessens symptoms and speeds recovery from viruses.<br /><br />Echinacea also has anti-inflammatory properites which aids recovery from psoriasis and eczema and may help arthritis.  It also may increase resistance to candida, bronchitis and herpes and other infectious conditions.  Echinacea should not be used continually for any longer than 5-8 weeks."

I split one for breakfast and a snack a few hours later, and it does the trick.  When I start my day off with a Luna bar, i am hungry just an hour later. They are sweetenned with Agave nectar which does not affect your blood sugar as much as sugar, nothing artificial and everything organic and raw makes these actually good for you!  They do taste a lot like figs and cashew butter, which might turn some people off but I think its delicious!  Raspberry Chocolate flavor is amazing too.  Calorie count is 276, which is fine for breakfast and lunch combined."
06	51091,B000FIXT2I,A10JXTD58PH332,10/31/06,9,9,5,Excellent product... will buy again.,"Ok, so you can cook up a bowl of chewy tasty brown rice for a lot less than the $2 this will cost you.  But it will take you the better part of an hour, and won't be any better than this rice which takes only 90 seconds.  So keep the non-instant brown rice around for those times when time isn't of the essence, and keep this around for when you need a quick, delicious bowl in less than two minutes.  It's really that simple."
06	80806,B003DMXDGA,A233H2J16V56W8,8/10/06,4,6,4,"Healthy,tasty, cheeze puffs","Its almost the same in taste as Cheetos except without the artifical coloring (these are light yellow, not orange).If you like Cheetos (puffs)you will like these and the ingredients are top notch.Not 5 stars because of the carbs;17g per serving.Otherwise ,very healthy snack and the price is fair enough though on the high end."
06	51090,B000FIXT2I,A118PDMU0IC7X8,11/4/06,10,10,5,"Convenient, Easy to Store, and Tastes Good","I would prefer freshly made brown rice, but that takes a long time to make and isn't easy. This makes it convenient, and takes all the guess work out of making it. I generally have been buying frozen organic brown rice, but that takes up lots of freezer space. The fact that this is easy to store at room temperature is a big plus. I'll be buying more."
